# [Artisans: Taste In Software](https://akashbajwa.substack.com/p/artisans-taste-in-software?utm_source=tldrfounders)

*Hey friends! I’m **[Akash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akashbajwa/),** an early stage technology investor.*

*I enjoy learning about how great companies are built and aim to share those learnings on startup strategy with founders & operators. You can always reach me at **akash@earlybird.com** to exchange notes and share feedback.*

About ten months ago, Rick Rubin, author of '*The Creative Act’,* became the subject of widespread satire for his comments on his skills as a music producer:

> *‘**Do you play instruments?***
> 
> *Barely*
> 
> ***Do you know how to work a soundboard?***
> 
> *No. I have no technical ability, and I know nothing about music.*
> 
> ***You must know something.***
> 
> *Well I know what I like and what I don’t like.. and I’m decisive about what I like and what I don’t like.*
> 
> ***So what are you being paid for?***
> 
> *The confidence I have in **my taste** and my ability to express what I feel, has proven helpful for artists.’*

I was reminded of Rubin’s comments as I read

’s interview with Karri Saarinen, co-founder and CEO of **Linear**.

Karri and Linear eschew conventional wisdom on the efficacy of A/B tests in product development and instead hone taste and intentionality to develop software:

> *We validate ideas and assumptions that are **driven by taste and opinions**, rather than the other way around where tests drive decisions.*

> *‘We as an industry optimized the process too much and created a Henry Ford–style feature factory where each role is very specific and **production speed is more important than craft.** (The other reason is A/B testing.)’*

has a wonderful essay on the rise of ‘**[Artisan SaaS](https://www.theglimpse.co/p/artisan-saas)**’, companies that are crafting premium experiences for digital utilities like email, calendar, contacts, browser, etc.

> *The world was hungry for **premium experiences** but anyone who had tried before had been crushed. We wanted **blazing fast interactions** that empower you to work at the speed of thought. We wanted **custom workflows** for us power users to help us build systems on top of the base functionality. We wanted a **brand** that made us feel something when we logged in instead of spending our days staring a the digital equivalent of a cubical.*

Artisan software may well deliver blazing speed, opinionated workflows, and a visceral brand, but the wholesale reinvention of experiences is its crowning achievement.

To do so, artisans listen closely to customers’ problems but actualise their own solutions and [practice their faith](https://every.to/napkin-math/every-software-business-has-the-same-playbook)..

**Superhuman** built product for three years before putting the product in the hands of customers (at which point they also began their now well known onboarding process). Rahul Vohra has [often discussed the pressures](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/57407355/vohra-using-emotion-to-design-great-products) he felt to launch a minimum viable product and how he relented as an artisan turning a utility into a premium experience with maximum delight:

> ***Patrick O’Shaughnessy**: One of my favorite debates in the world of technology entrepreneurship is the debate between sort of the **lean model**, where you're iterating and failing a lot and learning through customer feedback, and what I'll call the Keith Rabois **movie production model**, where it more sounds like what you've done, which is big long effort that is almost produced like a movie would be, with actors and a script and everything else, and you go to market with an incredible product, not one that's sort of been iterated through a crowd.*
> 
> ***Rahul Vohra:** I'm actually a big believer in both, and I would say we sit somewhere in the middle. I would say, raise a tremendous amount of capital up front. I would say, take your decisions as long term as you can. I would say, don't put out a minimum viable product, put out a **maximally delightful product**.*

Opinionated software melds customer pain with taste to derive premium experiences, neutralising [skeuomorphism](https://akashbajwa.substack.com/p/first-principles-of-product-in-the).

> *When you test your product out with people, listen to their problems. Learn everything you can from them. **When you deeply understand their pain, you can then come up with solutions they might not be able to see.***
> 
> *As a founder, you should spend significant time talking to customers. Hear their problems, but **don’t solve for their solutions.***

As AI democratise software creation, a world with [a billion developers](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-next-billion-developers-perspective/?utm_source=bensbites&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=daily-digest-microsoft-made-google-sing) will not lack for builders as much as it will lack for **artisans.**

was prescient in January in his predictions for artisan software:

> *Faster interaction speeds, keyboard shortcuts, and command pallets are all examples of the way **software is getting out of our way** and requiring less of our mental energy to complete a task.*

Software is indeed getting out of our way, faster than ever.

Investors are clamouring for founders to reinvent extant [UI/UX paradigms](https://read.readwise.io/search/read/01h4rsyx8z7mm3gmhh04mvzc69), compressing the steps required for humans to instruct computers. Multi-modal models and agents are building blocks for founders to build upon.

This week, **Pika AI** announced [$55m in funding](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/11/27/pika-ai-video-generator-editor-series-a/) for its text-to-video platform for prosumers.

This is what magic feels like, in December 2023. Let’s see how this statement ages.

If the endgame is Neuralink transmissions to instruct computers, we’re progressing at a good clip.

In the interim, the collapse of barriers to software creation will make artisans’ stock appreciate further. Opinionated software is here to stay.

ServiceNow, Salesforce, Workday and other systems of record have large installed bases that are reluctant to [shift to the public cloud](https://erp.today/sap-doubles-down-on-cloud-and-unveils-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition/), let alone undertake the change management of training employees on new UI/UX paradigms. The starting gun has been fired.
