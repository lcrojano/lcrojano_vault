# [Gamification: Strategies and Benefits for User Engagement](https://blog.openreplay.com/gamification--strategies-and-benefits-for-user-engagement/?ref=dailydev)

> The success of web apps often depends on how engaging the web app is. The more engaged a user is on your web app, the more they will contribute to the success of your app. So, to convince users to spend a lot of time on your app, return frequently, and become loyal customers, you will need to implement gamification in your web apps. This article will explore the world of gamification, its strategies, and the benefits you can gain from using them on your web apps.

When it comes down to creating web applications in today’s world, gamification plays a really important factor in user experience design. Gamification is incorporating game elements, mechanics, and principles in your web apps to help engage users and enhance user motivation. Several elements can be used in gamification, including competition, rewards, badges, and many other interactive features that help capture users’ attention. Engagement is not only about attracting new users to your web apps. It also involves making your web apps interactive and engaging enough to keep old users from leaving your app and losing them to competitors. Gamification offers an amazing solution to this problem by creating an interactive, compelling, and engaging environment on your web app.

### Elements of Gamification

The idea of gamification comes with many elements that need to be implemented if you plan on leveraging the benefits of gamification. These elements serve as the basics or fundamentals of gamification. What exactly are these elements? Let’s have a look at them:

1.  **Points, Badges, and Leaderboards:** Points, badges, and leaderboards are one of the core fundamental elements of gamification. Points are a type of element that allows users to accumulate a virtual currency or score within your web app. Points are usually awarded for an accomplishment, or they are given as an award for several actions. These points can help to serve as a measure of a user’s progress and successes within your web application. Badges are visual symbols or representations of milestones within the web app. Users can earn badges on your web app by displaying expertise in a specific area, hitting a certain goal, or completing a specific task. These badges give users a sense of accomplishment, and they can serve as a form of social currency within your web app’s community. Leaderboards display user rankings based on certain criteria like points, badges, achievements, etc. The leaderboard serves as a competitive element within the users of your web app, thereby causing users to engage more with your app.
    
2.  **Challenges and Goals:** Challenges are tasks that need to be completed within a web app to help boost user engagement and interaction. These challenges will give users a clear objective to aim for within a specific time frame. Upon completion of these challenges, the user may be rewarded with points and badges, or they may move up within the leaderboard of your web app. On the other hand, goals are the long–term objectives that need to be achieved by a user. Since goals last longer than challenges, it helps keep a user engaged with the web app for a long time. The objectives could involve leveling up to a certain status or winning a particular item based on time spent on the web app.
    
3.  **Rewards and Incentives:** Rewards are quite self-explanatory. They are prizes given to a user after completing certain tasks, reaching a goal, or gathering a considerable amount of points. Rewards can widely vary between discounts, in-app currency, access to certain items or features, etc. Incentives are motivational tools applied to push a user to carry out certain actions. These incentives may include time-limited offers, exclusive access to some features, and special promotions. Incentives create a sense of urgency that motivates users to perform specific actions to win rewards.
    

### Psychological Principles Behind Gamification

The main reason why gamification works and helps to boost user engagement is the psychological principles that are at play when it is used. Gamification uses the understanding of human instinct and psychology to create experiences that are enjoyable to users. Here are a few psychological principles behind gamification that you need to know:

1.  **Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation:** Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive that originates from within a user. This refers to the activities that a user inherently finds engaging and rewarding, and this can involve things like solving a puzzle, mastering a new skill, or overcoming an obstacle. It is important to apply gamification in a way that can tap the intrinsic motivation of a user and make the experience engaging. Extrinsic motivation involves external rewards and recognition. Extrinsic motivation involves elements like points, rewards, badges, etc, which give users external validation. The material rewards boost a user’s motivation to want to win more, thereby causing them to engage more with your web app.
2.  **Behavioral Psychology and Game Mechanics:** Gamification makes use of behavioral psychology principles to create experiences that are enjoyable and habit-forming to a user. It makes use of several concepts like feedback loops and positive reinforcement to encourage specific user actions. Game mechanics are the interactive elements and sets of structured rules that make the gamified experience enjoyable to a user. Examples of game mechanics include time limits to create a sense of urgency, progress bars to track progress, and interactive storytelling to capture a user’s attention to a narrative.

## Gamification Strategies for Web Apps

So far, we have understood the basics of gamification and the potential it has to offer. If you plan on Implementing gamification into your web app, there are a few effective strategies you need to employ to make the most of it. Some of these strategies include:

### 1\. Setting Clear Objectives:

It’s very important to set clear objectives before you head on to implement gamification into your web app. What do you plan on achieving through the gamification of your web app? To encourage frequent usage? To increase user retention? Or is it to promote certain behaviors within your web app’s users? When you set an objective, it will serve as a guide for your gamification efforts.

### 2\. Identifying the Target User Objectives:

You will need to create user personas to gain a deep understanding of your target audience. There are things to be considered, which include their motivations, demographics, and pain points. To better identify your target users’ objectives, you can conduct surveys and user interviews and analyze the data to gain insights. After gaining insights into your target user’s objectives, you can implement gamification strategies that perfectly align with the user’s objectives. This will help create user experiences that they find valuable and relatable because it suits their preference. You should also actively seek user feedback to validate your understanding of their preferences and objectives.

### 3\. Designing Engaging Challenges and Rewards:

When designing challenges, you should keep user engagement in mind. Challenges should be well thought out before they are designed, and this means they should be clear, compelling, and achievable. These challenges can include several elements like puzzles, quests, or tasks that should add excitement to the user’s experience. After completing a challenge, users should be rewarded, and these rewards need to be motivating. When designing rewards, it’s advised to try as much as possible to offer both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards to a user. Intrinsic rewards include a sense of mastery and achievement, while extrinsic rewards should include badges, points, or other tangible rewards.

### 4\. Incorporating Progress Tracking:

Progress tracking usually involves providing the users of your web app with interactive and visually appealing feedback on their advancement within the gamified system. Progress tracking can be done using progress bars, achievement badges, and status indicators. The main goal of progress tracking is to help keep the user informed on their journey and give them insights on how far they are from achieving their goal. Creating milestones and achievements to mark significant points in a user’s progress is also one of the key elements of progress tracking. Upon reaching a milestone, acknowledge a user’s achievement using celebratory notifications or visuals to get them hyped for the achievement. These milestones depend on whatever your web app focuses on, it can range between completing a tutorial, mastering a skill within the app, and even beating a high score.

### 5\. Personalizations and Customizations:

Giving users the freedom to personalize and customize a few things on your web app makes the experience a bit more enjoyable. Users should have the ability to personalize their profiles by picking an avatar, customizing their display names, and even changing background themes. The freedom to personalize their profiles gives users a sense of individuality within your web app and forms some sort of connection to it. Your web app should give users the ability to customize their preferences related to gamification elements. For example, a user can be given the freedom to choose their preferred challenges and their difficulty or the ability to create a custom character. It all comes down to what your web app has to offer.

### 6\. Competition and Social Interaction:

Implementing leaderboards should be another strategy to consider under the gamification of your web app. Leaderboards foster competition between the users of your web app, motivating them to climb the ranks and try to outperform others. All of this creates a sense of achievement and helps to boost user engagement. You should also enable users to compete or collaborate with friends and other users on your web app. You can make this possible by integrating social challenges. These social challenges can range between hackathons, in-game battles, etc. All of the above helps to encourage interaction and competition while also building a community that shares a sense of connection to your web app.

## Benefits of Gamification in Web Apps

Before this section, we have mentioned a few benefits that come with the gamification of your web apps. Each of these benefits serves as a stepping stone towards creating a better user experience for your web apps. To set things out in a clearer picture, we are going to dive deep into these benefits in this section of the article. Let’s dive in:

1.  **Increased User Retention:** One of the major benefits of gamification is that it helps to increase user retention within web apps. When users are engaged in the gamified experiences in your web apps, they are more likely to return. By offering users challenges, rewards, and progression, you can keep users coming back to achieve new milestones.
    
2.  **Increased User Engagement:** Gamification makes your web app more interactive, fun, and compelling. This helps to keep users engaged in the activities of your web apps, thereby boosting your engagements. Fostering social interaction within your web app is a strategy under gamification that plays a major role in boosting user engagement.
    
3.  **Enhanced Learning and Skill development:** If your web app is centered around education, training, or any area that requires the acquisition of knowledge, then gamification will prove to be extremely beneficial. By turning learning into a game, users are more likely to stay motivated and committed to the process, making learning feel like an adventure.
    
4.  **Data Collection and Insight:** Gamification also allows you to collect user data and gain insight into your target audience’s preferences and behavior. With data collected, you can get information on which challenges are more popular, which rewards are more motivating, and how users engage with the social features of your app. You can use this data to efficiently apply gamification and create better experiences within your web app.
    
5.  **Enhanced Brand Loyalty:** If you plan on creating a brand with lots of loyal customers, then gamification can be of help. When you integrate gamified loyalty programs, you can reward customers for their ongoing engagement and purchases. Users who feel valued and recognized through gamification are very likely to form some sort of attachment to your brand.
    
6.  **Community Building:** Gamification can help you foster a sense of community within the users of your web app. This can be done when you incorporate elements of gamification that involve social interaction and collaboration. When your web app has a thriving community, it helps boost your user engagement and can also play a key role in promoting your app to others who might be keen on joining the community.
    

## Examples of Successful Gamification

Throughout this article, we have explained several examples of gamification in web apps, which include points, badges, leaderboards, storytelling, etc. In this section, we are going to look at a few more examples in detail while also exploring a few real-world cases, like Duolingo’s language learning streak and LinkedIn’s profile completion progress. Let’s head on to these examples:

### 1\. Quest and Challenges:

These are examples of gamification that break down large tasks or goals into smaller components that can be achieved. For example, if your web app is centered around e-learning, a quest can be to complete a particular quiz. ![-](_Inbox/Read%20Later/assets/-.jpeg)

Don’t forget that each completed quest should come with its own set of rewards like points, badges, and even virtual items. These rewards can further motivate users to continue their Journey on your web app. Progression through a series of quests gives users a sense of accomplishment and direction, just like leveling up in a video game.

### 2\. Virtual Currency:

A virtual currency is a digital representation of value within your web app. You can gamify your web app in such a way that users can earn this currency through several activities. With this currency, users can make purchases, complete tasks, and engage in other engaging activities. ![-](_Inbox/Read%20Later/assets/--2.jpeg)

This currency can be spent only on in-app purchases that may have value to users, like certain services or items. For example, if you have a fitness app, users can earn a currency like “fitcoin,” which they can use to purchase various merchandise like water bottles, gym shoes, gym shorts, etc. This can go a long way to encourage users to engage in a web app.

### 3\. Unlockable Content:

This provides users with exclusive access to several features or pieces of information after they have achieved a certain milestone or completed a certain task. For example, a cooking app can give users free access to premium recipes. ![-](_Inbox/Read%20Later/assets/--2.jpeg)

This free access can only be obtained if they reach a particular level or pass certain criteria you choose. Unlockable content is an example of gamification that encourages users to explore and progress through several sections of a web app.

### 4\. Avatars and Customization:

Avatars and customization are another perfect example of gamification you can use to engage users. Avatars are a graphical representation of users, and they can be anything from a simple icon to a more detailed character. These avatars offer users a sense of identity they can project to the world. ![-](_Inbox/Read%20Later/assets/--2.jpeg)

Customization takes avatars a step further by allowing users to modify and personalize their digital personas. They can have the option to add complex clothing and accessories to an avatar or even backgrounds. The ability to customize avatars can empower a user to express their individuality, style, and creativity. This freedom to customize makes the whole experience personalized and makes users feel engaged with your web app.

### 5\. Learning Streaks:

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is one of the most popular platforms that perfectly incorporates learning streak. The platform offers a wide range of language learning courses to its users according to their personal goals or aims. The unique thing about Duolingo is that it has successfully deployed gamification to help engage and motivate users in their language-learning journey.

![-](_Inbox/Read%20Later/assets/--1.jpeg)

The streak feature capitalizes on behavioral psychology principles by encouraging its users to come back to the platform and practice their language skills every day. As users complete several lessons, they maintain a daily streak, which can earn them rewards. The impact of Duolingo’s gamification strategy should not be underestimated. The gamification feature is one of the top reasons behind Duolingo’s impressive user retention rates. Users are more motivated to engage with the app regularly to maintain their streak and earn more and more rewards because of it. This has led to Duolingo building a large community of dedicated users.

### 6\. Profile Completion Progress:

Profile completion is aimed at encouraging users to provide more information about themselves or engage with a web app by completing their profiles. When it comes to enhancing user engagement, this approach proves to be quite effective. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a real-world example that perfectly capitalizes on this. Progress bars are a common gamification element used for profile completion. When users create an account, they see a progress bar that indicates the completion status of their profile. When they input more details, the bar progresses to show that they are advanced towards completion.

![-](_Inbox/Read%20Later/assets/--2.jpeg)

The gamification element of LinkedIn profile completion involves a progress bar that guides users through the building of their profiles, as you can see above. As users complete several profile sections, they get a sense of accomplishment that is reinforced by the growing progress bar. This recognition factor from completing several steps motivates a lot of users to stay glued to the platform.
