> 2024 is just around the corner, and we have a perfect opportunity as leaders to trial and introduce the artificial intelligence (AI) tools that are going to give us a lasting competitive advantage in 2024.

This year has taught us that the teams embracing AI and getting adoption right are seeing significant competitive gains.

In fact, teams aggressively adopting AI with an adoption strategy are seeing as much as 250% gains in speed.

**That’s the equivalent of reclaiming 3 hours a day out of every 8 hour day.**

[Here’s some of this year’s research about AI adoption in software development, if you fancy a detour.](https://stepsize.com/ai-adoption-report?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=23-11-the-engineering-leads-best-ai-tools-for-2024)

So in this article, from a wide range of available tools, I’m casting the light on 12 of the best AI tools and AI software for software engineering teams to embrace, including…

-   4 tools for the SDLC
-   5 tools for shipping code
-   3 productivity tools

Let’s crack on then, and have a look at some of the very best AI tools for software developers.

## Part 2: 5 AI Tools for Shipping Code

## 5\. Sourcegraph Cody

**Cody AI is an advanced AI coding assistant for writing code faster.**

Maybe you’re expecting to see GitHub Copilot on this list. But it isn’t here. Why? Because today, there are far more sophisticated tools. GitHub have announced GitHub Copilot X, but it hasn’t arrived yet.

Cody uses advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to deeply analyse your entire codebase, accompanying documentation, and code graph. By doing so, it offers insightful and quick answers to queries about your software. The developers behind Cody claim that, by leveraging its capabilities, software development teams can potentially accelerate their coding processes by up to ten times.

**Key Features**

-   Code Navigation: Simply ask about a code location, and Cody will pinpoint it
-   Translate Language: If you’ve got code in C# and need it in TypeScript, Cody can do it for yoU
-   Code Analysis: Cody acts as a vigilant pair programmer, spotting everything from potential edge cases to suboptimal variable naming.
-   Debugging Assistance: Provide Cody with a code snippet and a problem, and it will generate a solution.

**My view** — Sourcegraph Cody appears to be an indispensable tool for teams managing extensive and intricate codebases. By simplifying code navigation and comprehension, it lets developers emphasize actual coding rather than laboriously deciphering their codebase.

## 6: Tabnine

[Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/) is an established AI code assistant for engineers.

As of mid-2023, TabNine is built on GPT-3.5 along with TabNine’s own architecture. it was originally built on GPT-2 in 2018. That said, it won’t be news to you that GPT-4 is radically better at reasoning, and competitors are making ths most of that advantage.

In that sense, Tabnine is far less experimental than other coding AI tools in this list. It’s a much better thought-out product, having had five years to evolve, and has a bunch of bells and whistles (many of which are valuable) that organisations might want to leverage. It’s totally transparent about what it’s trained on and is more legally robust. It can also run locally out of the box and accommodates various security and compliance requirements.

**My view:** Tabnine is a less experimental choice for teams that need reliability and security over cutting-edge tech.
