Rulebook:
1. At Least 1-2 Problem Solving(DS, Algo) questions on Hackerrank Daily(Heatmap
reflects your consistency). Not coding for just 2 weeks will put you back by a lot.
2. Only when you have solved it on paper should you go ahead and code it.
Otherwise more time will be spent overall debugging the code which is something
you want to avoid.
3. Interview experiences https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-interview-corner/
will let you know how recent interviews went in specific companies. If targeting a
specific company, go through atleast 10 of its recent interview experiences.
4. For every problem ascertain it’s Time Complexity(TC) and Space Complexity(SC) .
5. Only when comfortable with Easy should you move to Medium problems. This
similarly applies to Hard problems.
6. DON'T click run/execute code until you have checked and rechecked. When certain
that it’ll pass all edge cases, go ahead and run it. This grows your problem solving
ability and allows to create a realistic interview scenario where you will be coding on
a basic Google doc.
7. Struggle for about 1-2 hours at most while solving the problem. If all test cases
are still not getting passed, then read the discussion section where others explain
how they approached it. If this also doesn't work, then look on YouTube or Google for
that specific question.
8. Have a deadline of 3 - 6 months to become proficient.
Guidelines:
1. Revision methodology - anki, notes, etc.
2. Keep a copy on github for revision or reference
3. Once you start solving problems, you would get to see common patterns among
them. E.g. 2 pointer approach, BFS, DFS
4. Some companies such as goldman sachs ask puzzles as well. These are available in
the interview experiences of such companies.
DSA sheets: list of top 250 - 500 qns
Interview Guideline(steps):
1. Reiterate the problem to the interviewer to make sure you have understood it
correctly.
2. Ask about edge cases and write them down on the editor as a commented part in the
beginning . E.g. size of array, value 0, negative values, etc.
3. Give a brute force solution, then mention TC and SC
4. If he is satisfied with the brute force solution, then go ahead and code it. Else
optimise it and code it out.
