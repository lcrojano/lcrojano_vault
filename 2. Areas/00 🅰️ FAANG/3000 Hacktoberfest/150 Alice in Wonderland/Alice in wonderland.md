Given your role as a software engineer and leader of a team, here is an approach to managing "The Alice in Wonderland Project" for helping new developers learn GitHub and gain real-world experience:

**Project Objective:** The primary goal of the project is to provide new developers with practical experience in working on a software development team and to teach them how to use GitHub effectively. It's essential to maintain a focus on learning, accessibility, and community engagement.

**Team Structure:**

1. **Team Leads/Maintainers (Experienced Developers):**
    
    - Team leads should be experienced software developers with a background in working on real-world projects and using GitHub for version control.
    - Work in pairs to mentor and guide new developers.
    - Ensure onboarding, local environment setup, and the process of creating Pull Requests (PRs) are smooth for new developers.
    - They can assist new devs in code reviews and approving PRs, especially after new devs have gained experience.
2. **New Developers (Contributors):**
    
    - New developers should have a basic understanding of HTML.
    - Limit the number of new developers to ensure quality mentorship and a good learning experience.
    - Encourage them to contribute between 4 to 10 PRs during Hacktoberfest.
    - Provide opportunities for code reviews and PR approvals once they gain experience.

**Project Management:**

- Implement an organized project management system on GitHub. Utilize GitHub issues to track tasks, enhancements, and bug reports.
- Use project boards and milestones to manage the project's progress and to keep track of contributions.

**Development Environment:**

- Encourage the use of version control and collaborative development tools, focusing on Git and GitHub.
- Ensure all code contributions follow best practices and coding standards.
- Use semantic HTML and accessible forms to teach contributors about accessibility-first development.

**Communication and Collaboration:**

- Set up regular meetings (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) for team leads to sync up and discuss progress.
- Use communication channels such as Slack, Discord, or a preferred messaging platform for real-time communication.
- Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment by following a well-defined code of conduct.

**Code of Conduct:**

- Enforce a strict code of conduct to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment.
- Make it clear that hate speech, discrimination, or any form of disrespect will not be tolerated.

**Documentation and Learning Materials:**

- Create comprehensive documentation on how to contribute, Git/GitHub best practices, and accessibility guidelines.
- Provide learning resources for new developers to enhance their skills during the project.

**Project Maintenance:**

- Be mindful that this project is entirely volunteer-run, and all team members have other commitments. Ensure that the workload is manageable.
- Manage expectations regarding response times for Pull Requests, code reviews, and messages.

**Feedback and Improvement:**

- Continuously collect feedback from new developers to improve the learning experience.
- Iteratively enhance the project based on feedback and lessons learned from previous iterations.

By following this approach, you can ensure that "The Alice in Wonderland Project" provides a valuable learning experience for new developers while maintaining a welcoming and inclusive community for all participants. It also emphasizes project management, communication, and mentorship to guide new developers effectively.
