In some scenarios, a hybrid approach using both CSS and JavaScript animations can offer the best of both worlds.

For instance, you might use CSS for initial animations and transitions that occur when a page loads and then employ JavaScript for user interactions, real-time updates, or data-driven animations. This combination can provide the efficiency and performance benefits of CSS with the interactivity and dynamic capabilities of JavaScript.
