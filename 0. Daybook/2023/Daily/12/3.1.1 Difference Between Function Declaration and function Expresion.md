  
Certainly! Let's refine and expand upon the definitions of function declaration and function expression:

1. **Function Declaration:**
    
    - A function declaration is a way to define a function in JavaScript with a specified name.
    - It starts with the keyword `function`, followed by the name of the function, a list of parameters in parentheses, and a block of code in curly braces.
    - Function declarations <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">are hoisted in JavaScript</mark>, meaning they are moved to the top of the execution context during the compilation phase, allowing them <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">to be called even before they are defined in the code</mark>.
    - Example:
        
        `function addNumbers(a, b) {   return a + b; }`
        
2. **Function Expression:**
    
    - A function expression is a way to define a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">function as a value and assign it to a variable</mark>. Unlike function declarations, function expressions do not require a name (anonymous functions) and can be assigned to variables.
    - They are defined using the `function` keyword, followed by optional parameters in parentheses and a block of code in curly braces. The entire expression can then be assigned to a variable.
    - Function expressions are not hoisted like function declarations, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">so they must be defined before they are called.</mark>
    - Example:
        
        `const multiplyNumbers = function(x, y) {   return x * y; };`
        
3. **Arrow Function Expression:**
    
    - In modern JavaScript, arrow function expressions provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions.
    -<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> They do not have their own `this` context</mark> and are more concise than traditional function expressions.
    - Example:
        
        
        `const square = (num) => num * num;`
        

These distinctions between function declarations, function expressions, and arrow function expressions are essential in JavaScript development, as they affect scope, hoisting behavior, and the way functions can be used in your code.
