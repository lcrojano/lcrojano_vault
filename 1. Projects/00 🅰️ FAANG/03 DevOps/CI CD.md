- Continue Integration: 
Is the roces of creating artefacts such as testing, and check that ensures minimun standars you re willing to achive

- Continues Delivery

is an automated process that hellps you build deriberables ads releases but not deplying to a runtime enviromen

- Continues Deployment

is an automaed processthat helpyou buidl releseses and deploy then automatically inm your runtime envviroment.



**Continuous Integration:**

> An automated process of<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> merging code changes from multiple developers</mark> into a central repository, followed by building, testing, and verifying the resulting codebase to **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ensure it meets minimum quality standards</mark>**. These standards can include passing unit tests, achieving a certain code coverage percentage, or adhering to coding style guidelines.

**Improvements:**

- **Added context:** Explained the merging of code changes.
- **Clarified purpose:** Emphasized ensuring minimum quality standards.
- **Provided examples of standards:** Mentioned unit tests, code coverage, and coding style.

**Continuous Delivery:**
- **Focus:** Building and packaging code changes into deployable artifacts **ready for release** to various environments (staging, testing, production).
- **Key Activities:**
    - Takes verified code from CI.
    - Builds and packages artifacts.
    - Provides a pipeline for deployment to different environments.
    - **Requires manual approval for deployment to production.**
- **Benefits:**
    - Faster feedback loop with frequent deployments to non-production environments.
    - Reduced risk of breaking changes reaching production due to manual approvals.
    - Improved ability to test and validate features before release.

 

**Continuous Deployment:**

- **Focus:** **Automatically deploying verified and built code changes to production** (after successful completion of the entire pipeline.
- **Key Activities:**
    - Similar to CD, but with **automated deployment to production**.
- **Benefits:**
    - Fastest possible release cycles with minimal human intervention.
    - Reduced risk of deployment errors through automation.
    - Increased agility and responsiveness to changing market needs.


**Improvements:**

- **Defined as an extension:** Clarified the relationship with Continuous Delivery.
- **Specified the deployment target:** Emphasized deployment to production.
- **Explained the automation level:** Highlighted the absence of manual intervention.
- **Added potential benefits:** Mentioned reduced lead time and risk.
