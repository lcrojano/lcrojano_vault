  
The key difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment lies in the automation of the **final step**: deployment to production. Here's a breakdown:

**Continuous Delivery (CD):**



**Continuous Deployment (CD):**

**Analogy:**

- Imagine a delivery truck filled with packages (code changes).
    - **CD:** The truck drives to different locations (environments), but someone needs to manually unload the packages at each stop (deploy to production).
    - **CD:** The truck has a robotic arm that automatically unloads packages at each stop, requiring no human intervention (deploy to production).

**Choosing between CD and CD:**

- **CD is often considered a safer starting point**, especially for teams with high-risk applications or low risk tolerance.
- **CD can be adopted once a team has established a mature CI/CD pipeline and is confident in their code quality and testing processes.**
