## Learning Objectives

- Be able to explain that there are several programming paradigms
    
- Be able to explain the basic difference between the two predominant programming paradigms: functional programming and object-oriented programming
    
- Understand, at a very high level, how the functional programming paradigm works

it's a programming paradigm
there are two commons paradigms oop anf fp

in funtional programming there is a separation between data and functions, you can pass the values in the form of arguments, then inside the functions there are actions to be performed with those arguments, finally return some value.

we pass data only when we want something computed

in distinction with oop where functions and data could  be part of an object

in oop functions modify object propeties instead of only computing then to return new values .
	 
I can use return value from a function inside another function

it could make more sense to use oop when its logical to agrupate diferent properties and functions

the foundation of functional programming is the possibility to return custom values and perform new operations with results depending in the challenge that i am facing


To summarize this point, we can say that the Functional Programming paradigm works by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">keeping the data and functionality separate</mark>. It's counterpart, OOP, works by keeping the data and functionality grouped in meaningful objects.


Here are some of the most important ones:

- [[9.1 First-class functions]]
    
- [[9.2 Higher-order function]]
    
- [[9.3 Pure functions and side-effects]]
