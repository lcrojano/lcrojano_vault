# JavaScript Basics: Primitives, Composed Types, and Operators

## Primitives (7)

1. [[1.2 Number]]
2. [[1.1 String]]
3. [[1.3 Boolean]]
4. 1.4 Null
5. 1.5 Undefined
6. Bigint
7. Symbols
// JavaScript Types....

// Primitives:

// Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"

// Number : typeof instance === "number"

// String : typeof instance === "string"

// BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"

// Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"

// undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"

  
  

// Structural Types:

// Object : typeof instance === "object"

// Function : typeof instance === "function"

  

// Structural Root Primitive:

// null : typeof instance === "object"
## Composed Types (3)

1. Array
2. Objects
3. Date

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Modulus `%`

### Logic Operators

- Greater than `>`
- Less than `<`
- Equal ==

### Additional Operators

- Logical AND `&&`
    
- Logical OR `||`
    
- Logical NOT `!`
    
- Equality ==
    
- Strict Equality ===
    
- Inequality `!=`
    
- Strict Inequality `!==`
    
- Addition Assignment `+=`
    
- Concatenation Assignment `+=` (same as addition assignment - more on that later)
    

**Note:**

- Primitives are basic data types, while Composed Types are built by combining multiple values.
- Understanding operators is crucial for performing operations on data.
- The distinction between equality operators == and ===  is important; strict equality compares both value and type.
- The assignment operators (`+=`) are shortcuts for common operations.
