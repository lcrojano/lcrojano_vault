### First-class functions

It is often said that functions in JavaScript are “first-class citizens”. What does that mean?

It means that a function in JavaScript is just another value that we can:

- pass to other functions
    
- save in a variable
    
- return from other functions
    

In other words, a function in JavaScript is just a value - from this vantage point, almost no different then a string or a number. For example, in JavaScript, it's perfectly normal to pass a function invocation to another function. To explain how this works, consider the following program.


function addTwoNums(a, b) {

    console.log(a + b)

}

  

function randomNum() {

    return Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1);

}

function specificNum() { return 42 };

  

var useRandom = true;

  

var getNumber;

  

if(useRandom) {

    getNumber = randomNum

} else {

    getNumber = specificNum

}

  

addTwoNums(getNumber(), getNumber())


**This works because functions in JavaScript are truly first-class citizens, which can be assigned to variable names and passed around just like I would pass around a string, a number, an object, etc.**
