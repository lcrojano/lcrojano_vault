**Key Concept:** Hoisting of `var` variables can lead to unexpected behavior and global access, although they are "function-scoped" technically.

**Summary:**

- `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their enclosing function or global scope.
- **Misconception:** Hoisting might create the illusion that `var` can be accessed from the global scope, but using its name directly outside its scope will result in a `ReferenceError`.
- **Best Practice:** Avoid relying on hoisting behavior. Use `let` and `const` for block-level scoping and improved code clarity.

**Additional Notes:**

- This practice can lead to bugs and confusion.
- Understand hoisting for historical context, but prefer modern keywords like `let` and `const`.
