In this reading, you will learn about the history of JavaScript and the importance of ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) and ECMAScript.

JavaScript is a programming language that had humble beginnings.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It was built in only 10 days in 1995 </mark>by a single person,<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> Brendan Eich</mark>, who was tasked with building a simple scripting language <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">to be used in version 2 of the Netscape browser</mark>. It was initially called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">LiveScript</mark>, but since the Java language was so popular at the time, the name <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">was changed to JavaScript</mark> - although Java and JavaScript are in no way related.

For the first few years, after it was built, JavaScript was a simple scripting language to add mouseover effects and other interactivity. Those effects were being added to webpages using the `<script>` HTML element.

Inside each of the script elements, there could be some JavaScript code. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Due to the rule that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be backward compatible, even the most advanced code written in JavaScript today ends up being written between those script tags.</mark>

Over the years, JavaScript grew ever more powerful, and in recent times, it's continually touted as among the top three commonly used languages.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">In 1996</mark> Netscape made a deal with the organization known as<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)</mark> to draft the specification of the JavaScript language, and in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">1997 the first edition of the ECMAScript specification was published.</mark>

ECMA publishes this specification as the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ECMA-262 standard.</mark>

You can think of a standard as an agreed-upon way of how things should work. Thus, ECMA-262 <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">is a standard that specifies how the JavaScript language should work.</mark>

There have been <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">12 ECMA-262 updates - the first one was in 1997.</mark>

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">JavaScript as a language is not a completely separate, stand-alone entity. It only exists as an implementation. This implementation is known as a JavaScript engine.</mark>

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Traditionally, the only environment in which it was possible to run a JavaScript engine, was the browser</mark>. More specifically, a JavaScript engine was just another building block of the browser. It was there to help a browser accomplish its users' goal of utilizing the internet for work, research, and play.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">So, when developers write JavaScript code, they are using it to interact with a JavaScript engine.</mark> Put differently, developers<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> write JavaScript code so that they can "talk to" a JavaScript engine.</mark>

Additionally, the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">JavaScript engine itself comes with different ways to interact with various other parts of the browser. These are known as Browser APIs.</mark>

Thus, the code that you write in the JavaScript programming language allows you to: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">1. Interact with the JavaScript engine inside of the browser </mark>
2. Interact with other browser <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">functionality that exists outside of the JavaScript engine, but is still inside the browser.</mark>

Although traditionally it was possible to interact with the JavaScript engine only inside of the browser, this all changed<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> in 2009, when Node.js was built by Ryan Dahl.</mark>

He came up with a way to use a JavaScript engine as a stand-alone entity. Suddenly, it was possible to use JavaScript outside of the browser, as a separate program on the command line, or as a server-side environment.

Today, JavaScript is ubiquitous and is running in browsers, on servers, actually, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">on any device that can run a JavaScript engine.</mark>
