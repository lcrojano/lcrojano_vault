### Pure functions and side-effects

Another concept of functional programming are pure functions.

A pure function returns the exact same result as long as it's given the same values.

An example of a pure function is the addTwoNums() function from the previous section:

1

2

3

function addTwoNums(a, b) {

    console.log(a + b)

}

This function will always return the same output, based on the input. For example, as long as we give it a specific value, say, a 5, and a 6:

1

addTwoNums(5,6); // 11

... the output will always be the same.

Another rule for a function to be considered pure is that it should not have side-effects. A side-effect is any instance where a function makes a change outside of itself.

This includes:

- changing variable values outside of the function itself, or even relying on outside variables
    
- calling a Browser API (even the console itself!)
    
- calling Math.random() - since the value cannot be reliably repeated
    

The topic of pure and impure functions can get somewhat complex.

For now, it's sufficient to know that this concept exists and that it is related to functional programming.
