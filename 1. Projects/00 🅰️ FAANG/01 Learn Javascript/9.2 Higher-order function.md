**Higher-order functions**

A higher-order function is a function that has either one or both of the following characteristics:

- It accepts other functions as arguments
    
- It returns functions when invoked
    

There's no "special way" of defining higher-order functions in JavaScript. It is simply a feature of the language. The language itself allows me to pass a function to another function, or to return a function from another function. Continuing from the previous section, consider the following code, in which I'm re-defining the addTwoNums() function so that it is a higher-order function:

1

2

3

function addTwoNums(getNumber1, getNumber2) {

    console.log(getNumber1() + getNumber2());

}

You can think of the above function declaration of addTwoNums as describing how it will deal with the getNumber1 and getNumber2 inputs: once it receives them as arguments, it will then attempt invoking them and concatenating the values returned from those invocations. For example:

1

2

addTwoNums(specificNum, specificNum); // returned number is 84

addTwoNums(specificNum, randomNum); // returned number is 42 + some random number
