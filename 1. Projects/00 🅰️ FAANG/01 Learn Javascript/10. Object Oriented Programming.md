## The Benefits of OOP

There are many benefits to using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.

OOP helps developers to mimic the relationship between objects in the real world. In a way, it helps you to reason about relationships between things in your software, just like you would in the real world. Thus, OOP is an effective approach to come up with solutions in the code you write. OOP also:

- Allows you to write modular code,
    
- Makes your code more flexible and
    
- Makes your code reusable.

You are coding in OOP style. Why would you want to use the "this" keyword?

To declare an object's methods.

To refer the current method or function

To refer to the object itself without specifying the object's name.

Correct

Correct. The "this" keyword is an alias for the name of the object.
