**Key Concepts:**

- **Variable Scope:** The context within which a variable is accessible.
- **Hoisting:** The behavior of variables being accessible before their declaration (applies to `var`, but not `let` and `const`).
- **Block Scope:** Variables declared with `let` and `const` are limited to the block in which they're declared (e.g., loops, if statements).
- **Reassignment:** `var` and `let` variables can be reassigned, while `const` variables cannot.

**Summary:**

|Keyword|Scope|Hoisting|Reassignment|
|---|---|---|---|
|`var`|Function-scoped (or global if declared outside a function)|Yes|Yes|
|`let`|Block-scoped|No|Yes|
|`const`|Block-scoped|No|No|

**Example:**

JavaScript

``` javascript
// Using `let` for block-scoped variable within a for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // `i` is only accessible within this loop
}
```

**Best Practices:**

- **Prefer `const` by default** to prevent accidental reassignment.
- **Use `let` for variables that need to be reassigned within their block.**
- **Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript.**

**Additional Notes:**

- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):** The period before a `let` or `const` variable is declared, when it cannot be accessed.
- **Redeclaration:** Attempting to declare a variable with the same name in the same scope, which is only allowed with `var`.

**Questions:**

- Consider how these keywords interact with other JavaScript features, such as closures and modules.
- Explore real-world examples of how `let` and `const` can improve code readability and maintainability.
