**Key Concepts:**

- **Type Safety:** Tuples enhance code predictability and error prevention.
- **Fixed Length:** Tuples maintain a consistent structure for reliability.
- **Element Types:** Tuples guarantee specific data types within specific positions.

**Summary:**

- Tuples are a TypeScript type that define arrays with a **fixed number of elements**.
- Each element within a tuple has a **designated type**, ensuring type safety and clarity.
- Tuples offer enhanced code clarity and reliability over traditional arrays.

**Example:**

TypeScript

```
let myTuple: [number, string, string] = [42, "hello", "world"];
```


**Key Features:**

- **Fixed length:** Prevents unexpected length variations.
- **Specific element types:** Ensures data integrity and prevents type-related errors.
- **Access elements by index:** Like regular arrays (e.g., `myTuple[0]`).
- **Destructuring:** Assign tuple elements to individual variables for convenience.

**Use Cases:**

- Representing data with a known structure (e.g., coordinates, coordinates pairs, user information).
- Returning multiple values from functions.
- Employing pattern matching techniques.
