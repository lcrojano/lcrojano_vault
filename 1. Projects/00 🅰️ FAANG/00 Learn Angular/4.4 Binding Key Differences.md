  
In Angular, there are two primary types of binding: property binding and attribute binding. 

**Key Differences:**

- **Target:**
    
    - Property binding binds to the property of a DOM element.
    - Attribute binding binds to the attribute of a DOM element.
- **Usage:**
    
    - Property binding is typically used for properties that have corresponding DOM properties (e.g., `value`, `src`, `innerText`).
    - Attribute binding is used for setting attributes that do not have corresponding properties (e.g., `disabled`, `aria-*` attributes).
- **Syntax:**
    
    - Property binding uses square brackets: `[property]="expression"`.
    - Attribute binding uses square brackets with the `attr` prefix: `[attr.attributeName]="expression"`.
