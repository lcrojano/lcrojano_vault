# Lesson Takeaways

Template-driven forms allow you to define and control the form in the HTML template. 

They use the **`[(ngModel)]`** directive to bind the form controls with the class properties.

Upon user interaction, the values of the form controls will get synced with their corresponding class properties in real-time. Changes of the property values will also be reflected in the form.

This is why this is called **two-way binding.**

In case you want to handle the submit event of a form, use the **`(ngSubmit)`** event for binding.
