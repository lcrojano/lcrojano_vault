# Lesson Takeaways

In template-driven forms, you can define form validations in the template, just like with simple HTML forms.

To track the validity of the form, give it a name using the `ngForm` directive (e.g. #myForm="ngForm"), then access the state using `myForm.form.valid`.

The `ng-valid` and `ng-invalid` CSS classes can be used to style the form controls based on their state.
