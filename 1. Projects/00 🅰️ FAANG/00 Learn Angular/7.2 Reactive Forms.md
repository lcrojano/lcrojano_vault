# Lesson Takeaways

Reactive forms are more effective to build larger forms, as the form is controlled by the class.

To create a reactive form:

- Import the `ReactiveFormsModule` and `FormControl`
- Then declare your form controls, like: `color = new FormControl('red');`
- Connect the control in the template

```HTML
<input type="text" [formControl] = "color" />
```

- Access the value of the form control: `color.value`

In the next lesson, we will learn how to group multiple controls in a reactive form and perform validations.
