``` bash
ng new my-project-name --create-application false
```  
The `--create-application false` flag is used with the `ng new` command in Angular to create a new workspace without generating an initial application within that workspace. The Angular CLI allows you to have multiple applications within a single workspace, and using this flag is useful when you want to set up a workspace without immediately creating an application.

### When to use `--create-application false`:

1. **Multi-Application Workspaces:**
    
    - If you plan to have multiple Angular applications within the same workspace, you might start by creating the workspace without an initial application. This way, you can add applications later using the `ng generate application` command.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `ng new my-workspace --create-application false`
    
2. **Library-Only Workspaces:**
    
    - If your primary goal is to create an Angular workspace for developing libraries (shared code, components, services, etc.) rather than a full application, you might choose to skip creating an initial application.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `ng new my-library-workspace --create-application false`
    

### Why use `--create-application false`:

1. **Flexibility for Future Development:**
    
    - It provides flexibility by allowing you to decide later when and what applications to add to the workspace. This is useful when your project structure may evolve over time.
2. **Organizational Structure:**
    
    - If you have a specific organizational structure in mind where different applications serve different purposes or are maintained separately, creating the workspace first gives you control over how applications are added.
3. **Library Development:**
    
    - If your primary focus is on developing and managing shared libraries, and you don't need an initial application, using `--create-application false` sets up the workspace for library development.

### Example:

bashCopy code

`ng new my-workspace --create-application false`

After creating the workspace, you can later generate applications within it using:

bashCopy code

`ng generate application my-app`

This allows you to create applications as needed and manage them within the same workspace.

In summary, using `--create-application false` is a strategic choice when you want to set up an Angular workspace without an initial application, providing flexibility and control over your project structure as it evolves.
