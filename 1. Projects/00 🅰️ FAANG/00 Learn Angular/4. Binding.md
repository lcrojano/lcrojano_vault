[[3.1 interpolation]] is an example of binding

[[4.1 Binding HTML attributes]]
[[4.2 Binding DOM properties]]
[[4.3 Binding Classes]]



You learned that:

⭐ Binding allows to assign dynamic values to DOM properties and HTML attributes

⭐ To bind a property, simply place its name in square brackets and assign it to the expression in double quotes

```HTML
<input [value]="someVal">
```

⭐ Attributes use a similar syntax for binding, and need to be prefixed with `attr.`

```HTML
<button [attr.aria-label]="btnName">Click Me</button>
```

⭐ You can also set the class of elements using `[class.name]="expression"` for a single class, or `[class]="expression"` for multiple classes
