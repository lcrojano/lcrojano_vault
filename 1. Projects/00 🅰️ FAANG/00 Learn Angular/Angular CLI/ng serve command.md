The `ng serve` command in Angular is used to compile and serve an Angular application locally during development. When you run `ng serve`, it starts the development server, compiles the Angular application, and hosts it on a local server. This allows you to view and interact with your application in a web browser.

Here's a basic overview of the `ng serve` command:

### Basic Syntax:

bashCopy code

`ng serve`

### Options:

- **--open or -o:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Opens the default web browser to the specified URL.
    - **Example:**
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `ng serve --open`
        
- **--port or -p:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Specifies the port number for the development server.
    - **Example:**
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `ng serve --port 4200`
        
- **--host:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Specifies the host to bind to.
    - **Example:**
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0`
        
- **--prod:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Builds and serves the application in production mode.
    - **Example:**
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `ng serve --prod`
        

### Example:

Running `ng serve` to start the development server:

bashCopy code

`ng serve`

Running `ng serve` and opening the default web browser:

bashCopy code

`ng serve --open`

### Additional Information:

- By default, the development server runs on `http://localhost:4200/`. You can access your Angular application by navigating to this URL in your web browser.
    
- The development server watches for changes in your source code files and automatically recompiles and reloads the application when changes are detected. This live-reloading feature significantly speeds up the development process.
    
- The `ng serve` command is an essential part of the Angular development workflow, providing a convenient way to preview and test your application during development.
    
- Make sure to have the Angular CLI installed (`npm install -g @angular/cli`) before using the `ng serve` command.
    

Remember to consult the official Angular documentation or run `ng serve --help` for more detailed information about available options and configurations.
