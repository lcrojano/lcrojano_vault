When you come across a valuable article that sparks your interest and could contribute to your skill development or knowledge enhancement, it's crucial to efficiently save and organize the information for future action. However, the challenge arises when you accumulate numerous notes, making it difficult to locate specific entries, potentially leading to a loss of motivation and momentum. Let's explore several strategies to address this issue:

you are searching the web and studently found an interesting article that resonates with your propose.   But you don't have the item to make action right now. So you decide to save it for later.
But one problem arise, you have many notes saved for  later. You have already many tags for many topics, that, although it looks like being ordered, there are so many that its would be difficult to remember witch tag you used to store the note.

so what could we do to save the information without losing the motivation, the will and to don/t lose the will? lets check some options:
## By tag

so lets get an example, you capture in your [[Journal]] this:

- 12:00 Implement colours at [Colors](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Czp7U6htHSK/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==) 
- 13:05 Practice CSS animation with [OnScrollShapeMorph](https://github.com/codrops/OnScrollShapeMorph),

as you can see, you captured the URL, write about your desire and get a track of the idea you had in the moment. But although this is a good start, you star doing other task of your day, continue capturing different notes and task, and suddenly you lose motivations and momentum of what you was intending to do. You have no way to find the saved task or idea again and it just get forgotten.

### Without profundity
one way to avoid this is to ad a tag. But what kind of tag? if you start adding tags by topic, you will find yourself with a hundred of tags that even increase the problem of finding the note. so you need to add a tag that is related to what you want to achieve.

one example is a tag by project name:
- 12:00 Implement color at [Colors](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Czp7U6htHSK/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==) #Improving-colors
- 13:05 Practice CSS animation with [OnScrollShapeMorph](https://github.com/codrops/OnScrollShapeMorph), #css-animation-practice

in this new approach, you now know a tag based on a goal you have, so it could reduce the risk of losing the jornal entry.  
### With profundity

another way is by writing a hierarchy based on an organizational  methodology that you are using. lets take a look at PARA method. You will have 4 main categories: Projects, Areas, Resources and Archives. You could then add a parent category to each goal tags. it would make it easy to have a tag in different categories, you can easily determine what category the tag is belong to. but adds an additional abstraction cap. 

- 12:00 Implement color at [Colors](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Czp7U6htHSK/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==) #project/Improving-colors #resources/colors 
- 13:05 Practice CSS animation with [OnScrollShapeMorph](https://github.com/codrops/OnScrollShapeMorph), #projects/css-animation-practice #areas/learning 
 
### Without profundity, but with parent categories

Finally you could maintain a 1 step profundity by adding parent categories and goals categories separated. This would improve readability, and you have to write less to put each tag. but a problem could be a more complex data view query. one problem is that you can't directly visualize if a tag is from a project or an area. for example, is improving-colors an area or a project? or both?

- 12:00 Implement color at [Colors](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Czp7U6htHSK/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==) #project  #Improving-colors #resources #colors
- 13:05 Practice CSS animation with [OnScrollShapeMorph](https://github.com/codrops/OnScrollShapeMorph), #areas #learning #projects #css-animation-practice
## By attribute

by the other hand, you have the option to use attributes. You would not relay on tags for labelling the entry, but instead on as many attribute as you like. in example. This could be more flexible but is way harder to write.
- 12:00 Implement color at [Colors](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Czp7U6htHSK/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==) [Project:: Improving colors] [Resources:: Colors] 
- 13:05 Practice CSS animation with [OnScrollShapeMorph](https://github.com/codrops/OnScrollShapeMorph)[Project:: CSS animation practice] [Area:: Learning] 
### By wikilink

finally we have the option of using wiki links, this could help us to link a note directly to the jornal entry. one problem would be the difficulty to search the right note when there could be many with similar names. but one and most importan pros is that you will have a direct link to the note a one click distance, so you could start writing faster.
