to develop [[Alice In Wonderland - Game idea]]  

## Git workflow

 The team will use a Git workflow to collaborate on the game's development.

## Code review

 All code will be reviewed by at least one other team member before it is merged into the main branch.

## Testing

 The game will be tested regularly to ensure that it is bug-free and fun to play.
  
To implement the game in JavaScript, you will need to create a few key components:

- A game state object: This object will track the current state of the game, such as the player's position, health, and inventory.
- A game loop: This is a function that will be called repeatedly to update the game state and render the game world.
- A game engine: This is a set of functions that will help you to perform common tasks in your game, such as drawing text, moving sprites, and playing sound effects.

Here is a simple example of a game loop in JavaScript:

JavaScript

```
function gameLoop() {
  // Update the game state.
  updateGameState();

  // Render the game world.
  renderGameWorld();

  // Request the next animation frame.
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

The `updateGameState()` function will update the game state based on the player's input and the game's rules. For example, if the player moves forward, the game state will be updated to reflect the player's new position.

The `renderGameWorld()` function will render the game world to the screen. This will involve drawing text, sprites, and other graphical elements.

To start the game, you can simply call the `gameLoop()` function. The game loop will then run continuously until the player quits the game.

Here is a simple example of a game engine function that you could use to draw text to the screen:

JavaScript

```
function drawText(text, x, y) {
  // Draw the text to the screen at the specified coordinates.
}
```

You could use this function to draw the game text, such as the player's health and the current location.

You can find more information on how to implement text-based games in JavaScript online and in books. There are also a number of open source game engines that you can use to get started.

Once you have a basic game engine in place, you can start to implement the specific gameplay mechanics for your game. For example, you could implement the following mechanics for the Alice in Wonderland game:

- Movement: Alice can move forward, rest, or check her status. You could implement this by adding a button for each action. When the player clicks on a button, you can update the game state accordingly.
- Tea canteen: Alice can drink from her tea canteen to gain health. You could implement this by adding a button for the tea canteen. When the player clicks on the button, you can check the player's health and update it accordingly.
- Red Queen's Soldiers: The Red Queen's Soldiers are the enemies of the game. They will chase Alice across Wonderland. You could implement this by adding a sprite for the Red Queen's Soldiers to the game world. The sprite would move around the game world randomly. If the player collides with the sprite, the player would lose health.
- White Queen's Castle: The White Queen's Castle is the goal of the game. You could implement this by adding a sprite for the White Queen's Castle to the game world. The sprite would be placed at the end of the game world. If the player collides with the sprite, the player would win the game.

You can add additional gameplay mechanics, such as puzzles and challenges, to make your game more complex and interesting.

Once you have implemented all of the gameplay mechanics, you can test and debug your game to ensure that it is fun to play and bug-free. You can then deploy your game to a web server so that it can be played by people all over the world.
