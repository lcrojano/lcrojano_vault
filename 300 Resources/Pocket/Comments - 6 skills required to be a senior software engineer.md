One essential skill and it might be underrated is writing good & quality code which follows proper design pattern/principles(depends on project) and code reading ability which you'll definitely see in SE+ folks.<br><br>Expand full comment<br><br>Reply (1)<br><br>Share|

Even if you are working on cloud providers your apps are still running on some kind of Linux and you must be able to navigate around the environment. And sometimes you wonâ€™t be working on fully managed services like ECS, GKE, Lambdas etc. Also a lot of problems can be solved with some basic Linux/Unix tools like cron.<br><br>Also, I would add ability to split problems into smaller sub problems and write maintainable and reusable code with. But those are bit more apstract skills :)<br><br>Expand full comment<br><br>Reply (1)<br><br>Share|
