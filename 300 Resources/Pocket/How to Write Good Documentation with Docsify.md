  ![How to Write Good Documentation with Docsify](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2023/10/docsify.png)

Documentation is critical to a successful product. Without documentation, it's more difficult for people to use your product, and it's just as important if you're running an open-source project, too.

Creating a documentation site can be challenging, especially if you're not familiar with front-end development.

I have been a front-end developer for the past 8 years. During that time, I have used many frameworks to build documentation, like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [nextra](https://nextra.site/), [content layer](https://contentlayer.dev/), [Ghost CMS](https://ghost.org/), [lume (deno)](https://lume.land/), [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and [Mark doc](https://markdoc.dev/).

But to use many of these, you need to have essential knowledge about JavaScript, Next.js, and React. You may run into some challenges, like:

1. Lack of knowledge of JavaScript, React, or other necessary tools
2. Documentation versioning
3. Configuration
4. Deployment

In this guide, I'll introduce you to a powerful tool that can help you write documentation without needing as much technical knowledge.

## What is Docsify?

To help you solve this problem, I'd recommend a tool called [**docsify**](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Docsify is a simple and lightweight documentation generator. You can start using it without having any knowledge of JavaScript or React.

Docsify comes with zero configuration, no statically built HTML files, multiple theme support, inbuilt plugin API, and full-text search support with a plugin. It also deploys on a wide range of platforms like GitHub pages, GitLab Pages, Firebase Netlify, Vercel, and others.

I created a demo project to show you how to use it – the [source code is available](https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/docsifyjs) on GitHub. You can also [check out the live demo site](https://officialrajdeepsingh.github.io/docsifyjs/#/).

### How to Setup and Use Docsify

You can create a new project with the [docsify-cli](https://cli.docsifyjs.org/). To use docsify-cli, you need to install Node and NPM if you don't already have them installed.

```bash
npm install -g docsify-cli
# or
yarn add -g docsify-cli
# or
pnpm add -g docsify-cli
```

Install globally docsify

The command output looks like this:

```bash
❯ pnpm add -g docsify-cli

Packages: +198
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Progress: resolved 199, reused 114, downloaded 84, added 198, done
.pnpm/docsify@4.13.1/node_modules/docsify: Running postinstall script, done in 196ms

/home/rajdeepsingh/.local/share/pnpm/global/5:
+ docsify-cli 4.4.4
+ pnpm 8.7.0

Done in 13.9s
```

Command output

Create your new project with the docsify-cli init option.

```
➜ docsify init docs

Initialization succeeded! Please run docsify serve ./docs
```

You can also specify the `--theme` and `--plugins`.

```bash
➜ docsify init docs --theme buble --plugins
```

You can read more about [docsify-cli](https://cli.docsifyjs.org/) on the documentation page.

![Install the plugins with the docsify init option.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/09/docsify-plugins.gif)

Install the plugins with the docsify init option.

Next, start your local development server using docsify-cli. For that, run the following command:

```bash
docsify serve docs
# or
docsify serve .
```

Start local development serve

Your local server runs on a 3000 port locally.

Run docsify serve

Your website should look like this when you open it in the browser:

## Docsify Folder Structure

Docsify has a straightforward folder structure. By default, when you create a new project with [docsify-cli](https://cli.docsifyjs.org/), there are three main files:

```bash
├── index.html // This is an HTML entry file.
├── .nojekyll  // This is helpful when you deploy your project on GitHub pages.
└── README.md  // This is the home page or / router
```

Folder structure

## How to Customize Docsify

Docsify comes with lots of customization options, and you don't need any additional knowledge to configure it – it's pretty straightforward, just like copying and pasting code.

In this guide, we'll explore some of the most common customization options. For advance configuration, you can check out the Docsify documentation.

1. [Basic configuration](#basic-configuration)
2. [Loading screen](#loading-screen)
3. [Sidebar](#sidebar)
4. [Header](#header)
5. [Cover Page](#cover-page)
6. [Plugins](#plugins)
7. [Themes](#themes)
8. [Deployment](#deployment)

### Basic configuration

In the basic configuration, you can change or add a logo, a name, add your GitHub repository link, a theme color, and so on.

Here's the code to do that – you can fill in your own details.

```html
 <!-- index.html -->
 <script>
      window.$docsify = {
        logo: '/_media/icon.svg',  <!-- add logo -->
        name: "Document",  <!-- Website name it appears in sidebar. -->
        nameLink: '/',  <!-- url for name -->
        repo: "officialrajdeepsingh/docsifyjs",<!--github repository-->
        maxLevel: 2,  <!-- Maximum Table of content level. -->
        themeColor: '#3F51B5', <!-- Customize theme color -->
      };
</script>
```

Configuration in Doctify

### Loading screen

Enabling a loading screen or dialogue is typically very tricky, especially if you come from the JavaScript and React.js ecosystem.

![Loading screen in Docsify](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-2.gif)

Loading screen in Docsify

In Docsify, you can [enable a loading screen](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart?id=loading-dialog) without any configuration. You just simply write some text along with an HTML element inside your app ID, which will then show as a loading screen. It looks like this:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div id="app">Please wait...</div>

<!-- or -->

<div id="app">
<h1> Please wait... </h1>
</div>



```

Adding the loading screen in Doctify

### Sidebar

By default, the sidebar shows the table of contents. But you can customize it very easily. First, you'll need to [enable the sidebar](https://docsify.js.org/#/more-pages?id=sidebar).

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script>
   window.$docsify = {
       
        loadSidebar: true, <!-- Enable sidebar -->
  
   };
</script>

```

Config the sidebar in Doctify

Then create a new `_sidebar.md` file at the root level and paste the following code:

```_sidebar.md
- [Home](README.md)
- [Draft Article](draft-article.md)
- [Guide](guide.md)
- [First](page-first.md)
- [Second](page-second.md)
- [Third](page-third.md)
- [Four](page-four.md)
```

Paste the following code in the _sidebar.md file

Your sidebar should now look like this:

![Your sidebar looks like this.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/customizer-sidebar.png)

Your sidebar looks like this.

### Header

By default, you won't be able to see the Navbar on your Docsify site:

![navbar](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/navbar.png)

No Navar

But don't worry, you can change that. To show the [Navbar, you first have to enable it](https://docsify.js.org/#/custom-navbar) like this:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
    <script>
      window.$docsify = {
       
        
        loadNavbar: true,     <!-- enable navbar -->
       
      };
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then create a new `_navbar.md` file at the root level and paste the following code:

```markdown
* Getting started

  * [Quick start](quickstart.md)
  * [Writing more pages](more-pages.md)
  * [Custom navbar](custom-navbar.md)
  * [Cover page](cover.md)

* Configuration
  * [Configuration](configuration.md)
  * [Themes](themes.md)
  * [Using plugins](plugins.md)
  * [Markdown configuration](markdown.md)
  * [Language highlight](language-highlight.md)
```

Paste the following code in the _navbar.md file

Your Navbar should now look like this:

![customizer-navbar](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/customizer-navbar.png)

Customize Navbar in Docsify

### Cover Page

First, [enable the cover page](https://docsify.js.org/#/cover) in docsify with the following code:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script>
      window.$docsify = {
       
        coverpage: true,     <!-- enable coverpage -->
        
      };
</script>
```

The next step is to create a new `_coverpage.md` file.

```markdown
# Learn Docsify 
### Learn the docsify start from beginner.

[Start Learn]()
[Github](#/README)
```

Create a _coverpage.md file

Your website cover page should look like this:

![coverpage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/coverpage.png)

Your cover page 

The cover page and your UI depend on the theme, so they'll differ from theme to theme.

### Plugins

Plugins help provide additional functionality and features to Dicsify and enhance the user experience as well.

You can create and use plugins according to your own requirements. **[D**ocsify**](https://github.com/docsifyjs/awesome-docsify)** has many plugins available that are open-source and created by various contributors.

You can use any plugin by just copy-pasting the code. Even you can create your own plugins with docsify.

#### How to use third-party plugins

In this example, we'll enable the search bar functionally with the help of the docsify plugin.

To enable the search bar, copy and paste the following script inside your `index.html` file:

```javascript
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/plugins/search.min.js"></script>
```

Now the search bar will appear and work on your site. With the search plugin, you can also configure various functionality – read more about it on the [search plugin installation and configure page](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins?id=full-text-search).

![searchbar](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/searchbar.png)

Docsify Search plugin

#### How to create your own plugin with docsify

To create your own plugin in docsify, there's an inbuilt hook you'll need to use for the plugin.

Docsify has six inbuilt hooks: `init`, `mounted`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `doneEach`, and `ready`.

1. `init`: gets invoked one time when the docsify script is initialized.
2. `mounted`: gets invoked one time when the docsify instance has mounted on the DOM.
3. `beforeEach`: gets invoked on each page load before the new markdown is transformed to HTML.
4. `afterEach`: called on each page load after the markdown has been turned into HTML.
5. `doneEach`: gets invoked on each page load after new HTML has been appended to the DOM.
6. `ready`: gets invoked one time after rendering the initial page.

With the help of these hooks, you can create a plugin. To learn more about creating your own plugins, check out the [custom plugin document page](https://docsify.js.org/#/write-a-plugin?id=template).

In this example, we'll create an edit button using the beforeEach plugin hook. It shows the EDIT DOCUMENT button on every page.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
    <script>
      window.$docsify = {
        
        plugins: [
        
        <!-- write own custom plugin -->
        function editButton(hook, vm) {

          // call the hook
          hook.beforeEach(function (html) {
           
            var url = "https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/docsifyjs/edit/master/" + vm.route.file;
            
              // basic route fix 
            let tempFile = url.replace("docsifyjs/README.md", "README.md",)
              ? url.replace("docsifyjs/README.md", "README.md")
              : url;

            // Add Edit Button
            var editHtml = "[📝 EDIT DOCUMENT](" + url + ")\n";

            // Add edit button on top of file
            return editHtml + html + "\n----\n" + "Last modified " + editHtml;
          });
        },
        ],
        
        
      };
    </script>
```

### Themes

Docsify has both [official and community-made themes](https://docsify.js.org/#/themes?id=themes). You can use any of them, and the good part is you do not need to write any extra code when you switch themes.

```html
<!--vue theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/vue.css" />

<!-- buble theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/buble.css" />

<!-- dark theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/dark.css" />

<!-- pure theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/pure.css" />
```

You can choose to compress or not compress theme CSS files. The compressed CSS file is a minified version of the theme, and it is a lightweight CSS file for production. Other the other hand, a non-compressed theme CSS file is helpful for development.

You just copy the CSS theme (Vue, bubble, dark, and pure) file and paste it inside the head element. And with that, your theme is changed.  

In terms of non-official themes, I think the [docsify-themeable](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/) theme is the best option for you.

### Deployment

Docsify has various options for deployment. You can deploy your Docsify site on GitHub pages, [GitLab Pages](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=gitlab-pages), [Firebase Hosting](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=firebase-hosting), [VPS](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=vps) (Nginx), [Netlify](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=netlify), [Vercel](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=vercel), [AWS Amplify](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=aws-amplify), and [Docker](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=docker).

In some platforms like GitHub pages, you deploy your docsify site directly with the GitHub repository without writing any configuration.

Here's the process to do that:

You'll go to **Settings** > **Pages** > **Source** > and then select Deploy from a branch > **Branch** > Select your branch with folder and click on the save button.

![Deploy the docsify with GitHub pages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/github-deploy.png)

Deploy docsify with GitHub pages

It will take some time, depending on your website size. After deployment finishes, you should see your production URL.

![Finish the deployment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/10/deploy-github-pages.png)

Finish the deployment

## Conclusion

Docsify is a powerful tool for generating documentation sites. In docsify, you can focus on documentation writing, not UI design.

Docsify is a good option for developers who aren't that familiar with JavaScript. If you focus more on low-level languages like C++ or rust, docsify can help you get started writing your documentation with one command.

I recently used docsify for my [awesome-nextjs](https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/awesome-nextjs) repository. You can easily deploy on the GitHub page without any configuration.

Just keep in mind that there are two **downsides** to docsify:

1. Docsify does not generate dynamic SEO meta tags for a page. It only generates a title and description.
2. The docsify theme does not provide a modern UI feel.

But it's still very useful! Enjoy creating your documentation :)
