**Effortlessly Share Your Obsidian Knowledge with Others**

Obsidian, a powerful knowledge management tool, empowers you to organize and share your notes with ease. This guide will walk you through two methods for sharing folders in Obsidian: sharing a complete vault and sharing a single folder within an existing vault.

**Method 1: Collaborate with Syncthing**

1. **Set Up Syncthing:** Use the free [[SyncThing]] tool to sync files across devices by following the guide "[Syncthing How to Sync Folders Between Your Desktop and Mobile]."
    
2. **Share the Vault Folder:** Right-click on your vault folder and select "Syncthing" > "Add Folder to Sync." Give it a name and click "Add."
    
3. **Get Syncthing ID:** Find the shared folder's unique Syncthing ID in the Syncthing GUI.
    
4. **Share Syncthing ID:** Share the folder's Syncthing ID with your collaborators.
    
5. **Connect Devices:** On each collaborator's device, open Syncthing, click "Add Remote," paste the ID, and click "Add Remote." The vault will sync across all connected devices for seamless collaboration.
    

**Method 2: Focused Collaboration**

1. **Create a New Vault:** Make a new vault for the specific notes you want to share.
    
2. **Transfer Notes:** Copy or move the relevant notes into the new vault.
    
3. **Share the New Vault:** Follow Method 1 to share the new vault.
    
4. **Manage Access:** Adjust access permissions for each collaborator in the vault settings under "Permissions."
    

**Collaboration Tips:**

- **Consistent File Names:** Use uniform file naming to prevent sync conflicts.
- **File Locking:** Enable Obsidian's file locking feature to avoid simultaneous editing.
- **Communication:** Keep your collaborators informed about folder changes for effective collaboration.
- **Determine Your Approach**: Decide on how you want to handle your Obsidian team folders. Consider the organization's needs and policies.
- **Set Folder Access Permissions:** When sharing team folders, specify access permissions for each team member. Determine who can view, edit, or manage the contents of these folders.
- **Organize Team Notes:** Structure your team folders logically to make it easy for team members to access and collaborate on notes efficiently.
- **Training and Onboarding:** Provide training and onboarding to your team members on how to use Obsidian for team collaboration. Ensure everyone understands the best practices for sharing and editing notes in team folders.
