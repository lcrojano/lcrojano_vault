In the GTD methodology, the fourth step is "Reflect." This step involves regular reviews of your system to ensure that it remains up-to-date, relevant, and aligned with your current priorities. Here's a more detailed explanation of the "Reflect" step:

**1. Review Frequently:**

- The "Reflect" step emphasizes the importance of reviewing your GTD system regularly. The frequency of these reviews can vary depending on your needs, but it's typically recommended to conduct weekly and more comprehensive monthly reviews.

**2. Weekly Review:**

- During your weekly review, you'll examine your lists of "Next Actions," "Projects," and "Waiting For" items. This is a time to evaluate what you've accomplished, what's outstanding, and what you should be focusing on in the upcoming week.
    
- You'll also assess your calendar to ensure that you're aware of upcoming appointments, deadlines, and time-sensitive commitments.
    
- Additionally, you can process any new items you've captured during the week, clarifying them and organizing them into the appropriate categories.
    

**3. Monthly Review:**

- The monthly review is a more comprehensive examination of your GTD system. It involves reviewing your "Someday/Maybe" list and any long-term goals or vision statements you have. You may decide to promote some items from the "Someday/Maybe" list to active projects or next actions.
    
- This monthly review provides an opportunity to recalibrate your system, ensuring that it aligns with your broader goals and vision.
    

**4. Updating and Cleaning:**

- During both weekly and monthly reviews, you'll update and clean up your lists. This may involve marking tasks as complete, rescheduling or delegating actions, and adjusting your priorities as needed.

**5. Regaining Control and Focus:**

- The "Reflect" step is about regaining control over your commitments and maintaining a clear focus on what matters most. Regular reviews help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by your tasks and enable you to make informed decisions about what to work on next.

By consistently reflecting on your GTD system, you ensure that it remains a trusted and reliable tool for managing your tasks, projects, and commitments. This process helps you stay on top of your responsibilities and maintain a sense of clarity and control in your work and personal life.
