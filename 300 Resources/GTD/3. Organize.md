This is a step of [[0. What is GTD | GTD]]
In the GTD methodology, the third step is "Organize." This step involves placing the items you've captured and clarified into appropriate categories or lists to ensure they are readily accessible when you need them. Here's a more detailed explanation of the "Organize" step:

**1. Organize by Categories:**

- **Next Actions:** All the items that require immediate action and have a defined "next action" are organized into a list of "[[Next Actions.]]" These are the tasks that you can take action on without any further decision-making.
    
- **Projects:** If an item was categorized as a project during the "Clarify" step, you create a list of all your projects. Each project should have a clear outcome and a list of associated action steps. [[PARA: Projects]] 
    
- **Waiting For:** If there are tasks or actions that are dependent on someone else's response or action, you maintain a "Waiting For" list to keep track of these items. This ensures that you follow up when necessary.
    
- **Scheduled:** Items that are time-bound or date-specific, such as appointments or meetings, are placed on your calendar or scheduling tool.
    
- **Someday/Maybe:** Ideas or tasks that are not currently actionable but might be in the future are kept in a "Someday/Maybe" list. [[PARA: Archive]]
    
- **Reference Material:** Reference materials or information that you've determined to keep but don't require immediate action are filed in a reference system, which could be physical or digital. [[PARA: Resources]]
    

**2. Use a Trusted System:**

- It's essential to use a trusted system to maintain these lists and categories. This could be a physical notebook, a digital task management application, or a combination of both, depending on your preferences.

**3. Regular Review:**

- Regularly review your lists to ensure they stay current and up-to-date. The "Review" step is part of GTD and helps you make sure you're on top of all your commitments and projects.

The "Organize" step is crucial for ensuring that all your captured and clarified tasks and projects are stored in a system that you trust and can access easily. This organized system allows you to make informed decisions about what to work on next and provides a clear picture of your commitments, priorities, and obligations. It's the foundation for efficient task and project management in the GTD methodology.
