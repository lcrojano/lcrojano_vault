This is a step of [[0. What is GTD | GTD]]
In the GTD methodology, the first step is "Capture." This step is all about collecting everything that has your attention, regardless of whether it's a task, an idea, a commitment, or any other item that occupies your mind. Here's a more detailed explanation of this step:

**1. Collection Tool:** You should have a designated place or tool to capture these items. This can be a physical notebook, a digital note-taking app, a voice recorder, or even a simple to-do list application on your phone. The key is to make it convenient and accessible so that you can quickly jot down anything that comes to mind.

**2. What to Capture:** You should capture anything that crosses your mind and potentially requires action, consideration, or further thought. This includes work-related tasks, personal tasks, ideas, concerns, errands, goals, and more. It could be as simple as a grocery list, a reminder to call someone, or a big project idea.

**3. No Filtering:** One important aspect of this step is to avoid filtering or evaluating these items as they come to mind. Don't worry about whether something is important, urgent, or even feasible at this stage. Just collect everything, no matter how trivial or significant it may seem.

**4. Regular Capture:** Make capturing a regular habit. Whenever something new grabs your attention, take a moment to record it in your chosen collection tool. It's about creating a trustworthy system where you know nothing will be forgotten.

By faithfully following the "Capture" step, you create a safety net for your thoughts and tasks, freeing your mind from the burden of trying to remember everything. This sets the stage for the subsequent steps in the GTD methodology, such as "Clarify," "Organize," "Reflect," and "Engage," which help you process and act on the items you've captured in an organized and efficient manner.
