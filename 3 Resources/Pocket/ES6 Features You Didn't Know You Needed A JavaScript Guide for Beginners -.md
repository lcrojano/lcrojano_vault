# ES6 Features You Didn't Know You Needed: A JavaScript Guide for Beginners

[#webdev](/t/webdev) [#javascript](/t/javascript) [#programming](/t/programming) [#beginners](/t/beginners)

The release of ECMAScript 2015, popularly known as ES6 was a defining moment in JavaScript's recent history, bringing an array of features that have since become indispensable to modern web development with it. In this article we will try to explore some of these features that you might not have started using yet but i assure you, once you do, you will wonder how you ever coded without them.

**Template Literals - for Easy-to-Read Code:**

Before ES6 concatenating strings and variables was a complex task riddled with large potential for error. Template literals simplify this process by using backticks and `${expression}` syntax.  

```
const name = 'Alex';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to ES6 features demo.`);
```

 

**Destructuring for Easier Data Access:**

Destructuring allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables easily.  

```
const user = { firstName: 'Alex', lastName: 'Entrepreneur' };
const { firstName, lastName } = user;
console.log(firstName, lastName); // Output: Alex Entrepreneur
```

 

**Default Parameters for Functions:**

Function parameters can have default values that are used if no value is provided during invocation of the function.  

```
function greet(name = 'Developer') {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet()); // Output: Hello, Developer!
console.log(greet('Alex')); // Output: Hello, Alex!
```

 

**The Spread Operator used for Array and Object Manipulation:**

The spread operator allows an iterable item like an array or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments are expected by your code.  

```
const somecolors = ['yellow', 'green'];
const morecolors = ['red', ...somecolors, 'blue', 'pink'];
console.log(morecolors); // Output: ["red", "yellow", "green", "blue", "pink"]
```

 

**Arrow Functions for Concise expression of Function:**

Arrow functions offer a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically bind the `this` value.  

```
const materials = ['Hydrogen', 'Helium', 'Lithium', 'Beryllium'];
const materialsLength = materials.map((material) => material.length);
console.log(materialsLength); // Output: [8, 6, 7, 9]
```

 

**Use Promises for Asynchronous Programming:**

Promises denote a proxy for a value that is not necessarily known when the promise is created which allows for asynchronous execution of the code.  

```
const isSuccessful = true;
const dataProcess = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (isSuccessful) {
    resolve('Data is processed successfully');
  } else {
    reject('Data is processing failed');
  }
});

dataProcess.then((message) => console.log(message));
```

 

**Modules useful for Code Organization and Reusability:**

ES6 modules easily allow you to export and import functions, objects and primitives from one module to another.  

```
// file: mathsFunctions.js
export const add = (x, y) => x + y;
export const subtract = (x, y) => x - y;

// file: calculator.js
import * as mathsFunctions from './mathsFunctions.js';

console.log(mathsFunctions.add(4, 5)); // Output: 9
```

 

These ES6 features have drastically transformed JavaScript coding thereby making scripts more readable, maintainable as well as efficient. They encourage a more structured approach of writing JavaScript and can really help beginners avoid common pitfalls associated with the language's earlier pitfalls.

Begin incorporating these features in your daily coding practice today and you will for sure elevate the quality of your code. Don't forget to explore open-source projects like OpenSign to see these features in action and contribute to a growing community.

Nothing I wouldn't know but a nice list.  
Worth noting:  
Spread operator is sometimes less readable (especially for juniors).  
Arrow functions are anonymous and don't have things like 'this'. Sometimes execution context is needed. The '.bind' might not always work as you would expect it (assuming you know it... Many juniors wouldn't).  
Promises can be challenging - especially when mixing async (which is basically returning a promise but with some tweaks), typescript (you might encounter scenarios where typescript just couldn't be used as it would change logic and interfaces a lot).
