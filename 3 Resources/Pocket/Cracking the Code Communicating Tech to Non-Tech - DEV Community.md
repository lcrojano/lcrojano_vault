# Cracking the Code: Communicating Tech to Non-Tech

[#webdev](/t/webdev) [#devops](/t/devops) [#programming](/t/programming) [#discuss](/t/discuss)

Hey devs,

How do you get non-techies to understand you? I mean when we're chatting, at the coffee break, or when you're writing your release notes.

What are your strategies for ensuring that the average person understands our jargon (and incidentally that they don't get release notes based on "fixed bugs")?

Let's hear it!

I feel like, and this is just me being a brazen individual, that if you're spending your coffee break talking about code you're doing it wrong. Let that jam go, for ten minutes. Forty. Whatever! Just stop talking about your code when you're supposed to be on break. So that you can come back to it fresh as roses.

Now I spend most of my time around my partner. Who is in tech, and works remotely. So I actually talk tech (goober style, akin to a five year old describing an event) with my gal on the regular. Something I've seen perusing the old Reddit block is non-tech daters complaining about how absolutely abysmal it is dating tech workers. Because we just don't know how to turn it off. So I try, although I'm not sure if I succeed, and willfully phasing out to regular old average Jo when I'm not talking tech.

But also that's just about downtime. Explaining technical ideas, I suppose I can point yet again to a good old fashioned sub-reddit ELI5. In learning, as a beginner, I cannot understand a concept unless it's explained succinctly. Examples help. While there is no world in which this conversationalist can be succinct, I will say that being long in the ears/short in the tongue and to the point is gold.

Basically means -> if a non-technical individuals asks you a question -> listen to their full question -> ask for a second to think, they won't turn you down as long as you give a response within a reasonable time -> decode what they're asking/attempting to ask -> grab the answer from your "localStorage" -> boil that down to simpler action = result logic and respond with that. At least that's my assumption.

You can also always say what you think they want to hear (some people aren't even looking for a real answer, they just want to have an in to talk). Or they're looking for a sounding board, and just need to express something to you, without your input.

So that's my 411. As for jargon, I don't understand it either. But slang, I use it. But that's because I'm a putz. And putz' gunna do what putz' gunna do.

*p.s. - this is not an endorsement for Reddit - where happiness goes to die. Just saying I do browse it from time to time and there's some good stuff on there. Some...

Effective communication with non-technical individuals is essential for collaboration. To ensure understanding:

**Know Your Audience:** Understand their knowledge level and adapt your communication accordingly.

**Use Analogies:** Relate technical concepts to everyday experiences to make them relatable.

**Avoid Jargon:** Minimize technical terms and explain acronyms when necessary.

**Visual Aids:** Use diagrams and visuals to simplify complex ideas.

**Simplify and Clarify:** Break down complex ideas into smaller parts and use clear language.

**Encourage Questions:** Invite questions and feedback, and address them patiently.

**Engage in Conversation:** Listen actively and have a two-way dialogue.

**Get Feedback:** Ask if your audience understood and needs further clarification.

**Use Plain Language:** Keep language simple and avoid unnecessary technical terms.

**Training and Workshops:** Offer hands-on training sessions for non-technical team members.

By applying these strategies, you can bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team members, fostering better communication and collaboration.
