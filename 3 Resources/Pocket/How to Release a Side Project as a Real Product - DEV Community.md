# How to Release a Side Project as a Real Product

[#saas](/t/saas) [#product](/t/product) [#webdev](/t/webdev)

Many developers have side projects that they work on for fun, learning, or solving a personal problem. But what if you want to turn your side project into a real product that can generate revenue, reach a wider audience, and make an impact? In this article, I will share some tips and steps on how to release a side project as a real product, starting from the idea to release.

## [](#1-validate-your-idea)1. Validate your idea

Before you invest too much time and effort into your side project, you need to validate your idea. This means finding out if there is a market demand for your product, who your target customers are, what problem you are solving for them, and how you can differentiate yourself from the competition.

There are many ways to validate your idea, such as:

- Conducting market research: You can use tools like Google Trends, Keyword Planner, or SimilarWeb to analyze the size, trends, and competition of your niche.
- Creating a landing page: You can use tools like Carrd, Launchaco, or Unbounce to create a simple landing page that explains your product’s value proposition, features, and benefits. You can also collect email addresses from potential customers who are interested in your product.
- Building a minimum viable product (MVP): You can use tools like Bubble, Webflow, or Glide to build a prototype or a basic version of your product that demonstrates its core functionality. You can then test it with real users and get feedback on what works and what doesn’t.

## [](#2-define-your-goals-and-metrics)2. Define your goals and metrics

Once you have validated your idea, you need to define your goals and metrics for your side project. This will help you measure your progress, track your performance, and optimize your strategy.

Some examples of goals and metrics are:

- Revenue: How much money do you want to make from your product? How will you monetize it? What is your pricing strategy?
- Users: How many users do you want to acquire for your product? How will you attract them? What is your acquisition cost?
- Engagement: How often do you want your users to use your product? How will you retain them? What is your churn rate?
- Satisfaction: How happy are your users with your product? How will you measure their satisfaction? What is your net promoter score (NPS)?

You can use tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Amplitude to track and analyze your metrics.

## [](#3-plan-your-roadmap-and-milestones)3. Plan your roadmap and milestones

After you have defined your goals and metrics, you need to plan your roadmap and milestones for your side project. This will help you prioritize your tasks, manage your time, and deliver value to your users.

A roadmap is a high-level overview of the features and improvements that you want to add to your product over time. A milestone is a specific target or deadline that you want to achieve within a certain period.

You can use tools like Trello, Asana, or Notion to create and manage your roadmap and milestones.

## [](#4-build-and-launch-your-product)4. Build and launch your product

The final step is to build and launch your product. This is where you turn your idea into reality and share it with the world.

Some tips for building and launching your product are:

- Use the best tools for the job: Depending on the complexity and scope of your product, you may need different tools for coding, designing, testing, deploying, hosting, etc. Choose the tools that suit your needs, budget, and skills.
- Follow the best practices: Follow the best practices for software development, such as using version control, writing clean code, documenting your work, testing your code, etc.
- Seek feedback: Seek feedback from other developers, mentors, experts, or potential users throughout the development process. This will help you improve your product quality, usability, and functionality.
- Launch early and often: Don’t wait until your product is perfect to launch it. Launch it as soon as it has enough value for your users. Then iterate based on the feedback and data that you collect.

You can use platforms like Product Hunt, Hacker News, or Reddit to launch and promote your product.
