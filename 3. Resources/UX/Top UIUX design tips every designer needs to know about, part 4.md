## 1\. Don’t overdo it with borders

While outlines and background colors can add a lot to your designs, it’s crucial not to go overboard. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Overuse of borders can clutter your interface and make it look busy, confusing, or outdated</mark>. Excess lines and colors can<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> detract from the content </mark>itself, making the UI feel overcomplicated and harder to navigate.

For example, consider a UI that uses multiple borders and several different background colors for each section. Though the intention might be to clearly define areas, the result is often a visual overload. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Too many borders and colors can overwhelm the user, making it challenging to focus on essential elements.</mark>

In the second example, you’ll notice that no borders are used; instead,<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> the design relies on colors and a generous amount of white space to separate different sections like results and buttons. </mark>This creates a clean, uncluttered look that makes the interface easier to navigate.

When used sparingly and intentionally, borders can be effective. But it’s crucial to find the right balance. Overdoing it can detract from your design’s usability and aesthetic appeal. On the other hand, smart use of white space and background colors can achieve the same goals of separation and focus, without the added visual noise.

## 2\. If we use borders, they should be thin and light

When it comes to utilizing borders in your UI designs, subtlety is key. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Thick, dark, or prominent borders can overpower your content, making the interface feel heavy and outdated.</mark>

On the other hand,<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> thin and light borders can elegantly define different sections without stealing the spotlight.</mark> These less intrusive borders also help maintain a light and open aesthetic, which is easier on the eyes and makes for a more pleasant user experience.

So, the next time you’re considering adding a border, remember: less is often more. Go for subtle lines that perform their job without drawing unnecessary attention to themselves.

## 3\. Avoid too light colours for your text

Imagine you’re at a coffee shop, trying to read an article on your phone. If the text is too light of a gray, you might find yourself squinting or even tilting the screen to catch the words. Not a great user experience, right?

Designers sometimes opt for light gray text in the name of minimalism or aesthetic appeal. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">While it may look sleek and modern, it can be really challenging to read,</mark> especially for users with poorer vision.
