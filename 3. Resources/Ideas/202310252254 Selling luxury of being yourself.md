As time passes, people often find it challenging to allocate time for learning, meditation, and deep thinking. Therefore, there's an opportunity to offer them the luxury of time-saving, making their efforts more efficient, and allowing them to be themselves.

To accomplish this, you need to discover methods for teaching that are quicker, require less effort, and minimize obstacles. While it may seem like an idealistic vision, many individuals are willing to invest in such solutions.
