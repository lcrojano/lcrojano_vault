> The following is an internal discussion post from the engineering department at GitHub formatted in GitHub flavored Markdown. Please write a short summary appropriate for inclusion in a digest of internal discussion posts with the following requirements: - The summary should be no more than 3 sentences - The summary should focus on the most important and impactful information from the post, including key points and any calls to action - The summary should be detailed, thorough, to-the-point, and written for a technical audience, while maintaining clarity and conciseness - The communications style should be professional, but informal - The summary should use emoji where appropriate, but use emoji sparingly - The summary should be formatted in GitHub Flavored Markdown with no line breaks - DO NOT use the phrases "the engineering department" or "at GitHub"; instead, whenever possible, name the specific team in reference, or else use "we" to refer to the team or engineering department. For example, use, "We recently shipped a feature", and NOT, "The engineering department at GitHub recently shipped a feature". - Employees at GitHub are referred to as "Hubbers" - GitHub is ALWAYS capitalized as "GitHub", never "Github" - Teams are referred to as "the Actions team" or "the Copilot team", never just "actions team" or "copilot team"
