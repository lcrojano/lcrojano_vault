IBM Hyperledger

GROUP 1
Graduated projects
Aries - manages secret keys
Besu - ETHEREUM
Fabric - IBM modular tech integrated into Stellar
Indy - interoperable across all blockchains or standalone
Iroha - crash fault tolerant algo
Sawtooth - smart contracts for Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance

PBFT = what 96 of the system can crash while still allowing you to
operate your system

Bitcoin and Ethereum are 46-506 in IDEAL conditions and drop to
096 when internet crashes. So once you flip the internet switch
(Project Odin) BTC ETH crash to $0

Group 1 summary:
Oversees Ethereum and other blockchains, can manipulate the fault
tolerance and crash to 0, manages all the secret keys to allow white
hats to hack baddies, controlled by IBM

GROUP 2
Incubation projects
Bevel - accelerator across public and private cloud providers (white
hat version of Amazon Web Services, Google)
Cactus - securely integrate different blockchains
Firefly - first ever Supernode to build dApps faster
Explorer - user-friendly quantum programming enhancement
Ursa - crypto library for enhanced security

Group 2 summary:
Security security security !!!
White hats using Hyperledger to secure all blockchains after
hijacking them in Group 1

GROUP 3
Incubation 2 + dormant projects
Transact - AIML smart contracts for quantum automation
Cello - operational dashboard for Space Force and Global Military
Alliance
Caliper - performance benchmark tool to monitor blockchain
implementation, especially for system error warnings and success
metrics. Note: ONLY PROJECT NOT USING APACHE 2.0
Burrow - sophisticated database mapping with built-in governance
and permissions (like ATOM by Deloitte)
Grid - supply chain metrics and data models for business smart
contracts
Quilt - Java implementation of Interledger Protocol (ISO20022) for
payments across ANY PAYMENT NETWORK (physical, digital, crypto)

Group 3 summary:
This is the beginnings of integration and interoperability for Protocol
20 and future Smart Cities

Here is the full, original NESARA Bill (that
apparently doesn't exist):

"To amend the Federal Reserve Act of
1913, as amended; and the Internal
Revenue Code of 1939, as amended; in
order to secure for the American people
their unalienable right to Life, Liberty,
and Property."

This is The Great Awakening.
