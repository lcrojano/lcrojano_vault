Debt Relief for 25 Countries

April 13, 2020

Washington, DC - Ms. Kristalina Georgieva.
Managing Director of the International Monetary
Fund [IMF) issued the following statement:

"Today. I am pleased to say that our Executive
Board approved immediate debt service relief to
25 of the IMF's member countries under the IMF's
revamped Catastrophe Containment and Reliet
Trust (CCRT) as part of the Fund's response to help
address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"This provides grants to our poorest and most
vulnerable members to cover their IMF debt
abligations for an initial phase over the next six
months and will help them channel more of their
scarce financial resources towards vital emergency
medical and other relief efforts.

"The CCRT can currently provide about US$500
million in grant-based debt service relief. including
the recent US$185 million pledge by the U.K. and
U5$100 million provided by Japan as immediately
available resources. Others, including China and
the Netherlands are also stennina forward with

April 2020 IMF debt relief for 25 of the poorest countries in the world.
GESARA starts with helping the poorest have a "level playing field"

June 29, 2022 BIS "The future monetary system"

CBDCs must use DLT (DLT = all the BIS Projects) to ensure additional
functionality, such as guaranteeing congruity of legitimate
transactions using legitimate (non counterfeit) tokens:

This is done by DLT having the power to legitimize the source/origin
of the asset. Meaning they can confirm the asset came from a
legitimate source without having to publicly reveal the personal info
of each wallet on the chain of transactions. It can also use a notary
to prevent the same token being fraudulently spent twice

New settlement programmability can include Atomic (inseparable
transactions are executed together or not at all) and Composability
(combining several transactions into one - smart contracts) and
Tokenization

BIS also confirming they are pursuing "interoperability and financial
inclusion as the key goals" (this is Stellar)

Multi CBDCs confirmed on XX maps

"One thing is for sure: all of them will be supported by the tree firmly
rooted in the ultimate settlement on the central bank's balance sheet ...
Central banks as guardians of the monetary system are embarked on a
long journey in fulfilling the vision of the future monetary system" -Hyun
