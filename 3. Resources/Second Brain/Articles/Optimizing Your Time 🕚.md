If you don’t learn to optimize your time as a founder, you will find yourself quickly overwhelmed. These tips can help!

### Identify recurring tasks

You can’t do every single task required for your business on a daily basis. Think about the types of tasks that you need to do on a recurring basis. These could be things like emails, social media posts, administrative tasks, etc. Write them all down. Then, think about how often you _need_ to do these tasks.

### Organize your tasks into batches

Identify the tasks that go well together, then put them into batches. Here’s an example of a typical founder’s day:

And here are those tasks moved into batches:

### Assign your batches to specific days

Now that you have your batches, take it a step further and apply them to specific days. Ideally, you would have just one batch a day.

### Do the quickest task first

An easy trick here is to organize your tasks by how much time each one is likely to take:

- Do the five minute task first.
- Move on to the 15 minute task.
- Next, do the one hour task.
- Finally, complete the three hour task.

It can sometimes be hard to get started, and by doing the easiest thing first, you jumpstart the process and gradually build up momentum. Then, it’s much easier to blast through the bigger tasks.
