Our memory sucks, in both the short-term and the long-term. Short-term memory in particular, specifically working memory, is abysmally small. But everything changes with a simple sheet of paper.

Paper is a tool that expands your practical working memory. I call this artificial working memory. No, it has nothing to do with AI or machine learning. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It is simply any tool that expands your practical working memory, allowing you to solve more complex problems</mark>.

Overriding the limit of our biological working memory with artificial working memory is a key to making better decisions.

Decision-making is a hard, complex endeavor. To make better decisions, in simple terms, write things down. Treat decision-making like it is a math problem.

### Leveraging artificial working memory for decision-making

There are three simple steps:

1. Write down the problem and everything that relates to it.
    
2. Break the problem down into manageable sub-problems, and solve those problems.
    
3. Use the answers to the sub-problems to then solve the main problem.
    

### A real world example

Letâ€™s say youâ€™ve decided to buy a house. You have hundreds of pieces of information. Write down what your choices are, what your priorities are, and what is non-negotiable. Size requirement? Write that down. Budget? Write that down.

When your choices are narrowed down to just a few houses that match all of your most important criteria, start looking at details. Write down what you really like and really hate about each house.

Finally, after you have all this information written down for the houses you think are the best candidates, start comparing them to make a final choice.

Ten years later, when you feel the need to move again, you can look back on what you prioritized and what you didnâ€™t in your house buying experience, and reflect on the mistakes you made during the process.

You can apply this same process to a business decision, engineering decision, or relationship problem.
