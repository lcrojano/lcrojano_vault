#monthly 
Once a month, take an hour to clean up your digital workspace:  
  
• Delete unnecessary files  
  
• Organize your documents  
  
• Clear your desktop  
  
• Move old information to your archives  
  
It’s like a reset button for your productivity and clears the way for your focus to stay sharp, rather than getting sidetracked by digital clutter.
