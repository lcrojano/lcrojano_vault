I'm a big proponent of creating personal rules to and free up mental bandwidth.  
  
Here are 7 rules I've developed for myself around task management:  
  
1. I have to write down a task as soon as I notice it. I'm not allowed to "keep it in mind".  
  
2. Every task needs to have a “physical next action” (i.e. it can’t be “thinking about,” “deciding,” or “considering”).  
  
3. If it takes less than two minutes, I'll do the task right away instead of adding it to my to-do list. This is called the “2-Minute Rule”.  
  
4. I don't create tasks to “read” or “watch” things. Those are saved in Reader, my read-later app.  
  
5. I can only mark tasks as “high priority” if I can take action on them. And I’m not waiting on someone else to do something first.  
  
6. All tasks need to have all critical pieces of information required to do them such as a phone number, email address, or link.  
  
7. Mornings are reserved for deep work. I'm only allowed to work on light, easy tasks in the afternoon when my energy is lower anyway.  
  
These rules work for me, but they may not work for you.  
  
You have to develop your own guidelines that take into consideration your goals, strengths, weaknesses, and environment.  
  
Often, you already follow certain rules subconsciously. There's value in writing them down.  
  
What personal rules do you follow?
