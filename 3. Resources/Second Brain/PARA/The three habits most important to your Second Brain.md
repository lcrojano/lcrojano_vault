**Weekly and Monthly Reviews**<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">: Periodically review </mark>your work and life and decide if you want to change anything.

**Noticing Habits**: Notice small<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> opportunities to edit, highlight, or move notes to make them more discoverable for your future self</mark>.   You can think of these habits as the “maintenance schedule” of your Second  Brain. Just like you have a maintenance schedule for your car, which advises you

Brain occasionally needs a tune-up to ensure it’s in good working order.
