This is a step of [[0. What is GTD | GTD]]
In the GTD methodology, the second step is "Clarify." This step involves processing the items you've captured in the "Capture" phase to determine their significance and what actions are needed. Here's a detailed explanation of the "Clarify" step:

**1. Process What It Means:** In this step, you go through each item you've captured and decide what it means and what you need to do about it. This involves making a clear decision about the item's nature and next steps.

**2. Is It Actionable?:** The first question you ask is whether the item is actionable. In other words, can you take a specific, concrete action to move it forward? If it's not actionable, it falls into one of the following categories:

- **Trash:** If the item is no longer relevant or useful, you can safely discard it.
    
- **Reference:** Some items may not require action but are valuable for future reference. These could be documents, articles, or information you want to keep.
    
- **Someday/Maybe:** If an idea or task is not immediately actionable but you want to keep it for future consideration, it can be placed in a "Someday/Maybe" list.
    

**3. If It's Actionable:** If the item is actionable, you proceed to decide on the next steps. This can involve identifying:

- **The Next Action:** Determine the very next physical action that needs to be taken to move the item forward. This should be a concrete, specific task that you can accomplish in one step. For example, if the item is "Plan vacation," the next action might be "Research travel destinations."
    
- **Project:** If the item requires more than one action step to complete, it's considered a project. Define what the project outcome should be and list all the associated actions required to achieve that outcome.
    

**4. Organization:** Once you've clarified an item and determined its next action or categorized it as non-actionable, you then organize it accordingly. Actionable items are added to your "Next Actions" list, while projects are noted and broken down into actionable steps. Reference items are filed away for easy retrieval when needed.

The "Clarify" step is critical for turning a jumble of thoughts and ideas into a well-organized system of actionable tasks and projects. By making clear decisions about what to do next and how to do it, you set the stage for increased productivity and effective time management in the subsequent steps of the GTD methodology.
