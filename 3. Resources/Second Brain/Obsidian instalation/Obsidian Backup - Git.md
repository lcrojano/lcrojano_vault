# Backup with Git and GitHub

## 1. Consider Obsidian Git
You can also use Obsidian Git to manage your notes. However, there might be limitations when using it on mobile due to a lack of a complete Git version.

**Additional Steps for Using Obsidian Git:**

### a. Install Git on Mobile (if possible)
Check if there's a mobile Git client available for your device. This will allow you to use Obsidian Git on your mobile.

### b. Sync with Desktop Git
When using Obsidian Git, ensure that you synchronize your notes with your desktop's Git repository. This keeps your mobile notes up to date with changes made on your desktop.

## 2. Challenges with Obsidian in WSL2
Working with Obsidian inside Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) can be a bit complicated. You may encounter compatibility issues that need attention.

**Additional Considerations for WSL2:**

### a. System Compatibility
Make sure your system meets the requirements for running WSL2. Check the official documentation for any updates or prerequisites.

### b. Compatibility Mode
Try running Obsidian in compatibility mode if you encounter issues within WSL2. Some users find that this resolves compatibility problems.
