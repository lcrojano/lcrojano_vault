**Date:** Wednesday, November 22, 2023 **Time:** 11:30 PM

**Summary:**

Encountered an error message "Acceso denegado. Error code: Wsl/E_ACCESSDENIED" while attempting to import an ext4.vhdx file into a WSL distribution using the `wsl --import` command. The file was locked by the System process, preventing the import operation.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Removed System permissions from ext4.vhdx:** a. Navigated to the file properties and accessed the "Security" tab. b. Clicked "Advanced" and then "Change permissions." c. Selected "Administrators" from the user list and granted "Full control" permission. d. Unchecked the box next to "Inherit permissions from parent objects" under "Advanced security settings."
    
2. **Imported ext4.vhdx using wsl --import:** a. Opened Windows PowerShell with administrator privileges. b. Navigated to the directory containing the ext4.vhdx file. c. Executed the command: `wsl --import -d Ubuntu20.06 -f ext4.vhdx`
    
3. **Created a backup of ext4.vhdx:** a. Uploaded the ext4.vhdx file to TeraBox for safekeeping.
    

**Outcome:**

The System permissions were successfully removed from the ext4.vhdx file, allowing the WSL process to access and import the file without any restrictions. The import operation completed successfully, and the Ubuntu 20.06 WSL distribution was created. Additionally, a backup of the ext4.vhdx file was created on TeraBox for future reference and recovery.

**Lessons Learned:**

- System permissions can restrict access to files, preventing certain processes from accessing them.
- Removing System permissions can be done carefully to allow specific processes access.
- Backing up important files is crucial in case of unforeseen circumstances.

**Notes:**

- The entire process took approximately 15 minutes.
- The issue was resolved without any data loss or corruption.
- The backup on TeraBox ensures the availability of the ext4.vhdx file for future use.
