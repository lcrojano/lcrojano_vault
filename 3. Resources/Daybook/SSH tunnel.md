  
ssh root@167.99.186.23 -L 3336:localhost:3306

This code is used to establish an SSH tunnel from your local machine to a remote server. The tunnel will forward traffic on port 3336 on your local machine to port 3306 on the remote server. This means that any applications that connect to port 3336 on your local machine will actually be connecting to port 3306 on the remote server.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- `ssh root@167.99.186.23`: This part of the code initiates an SSH connection to the remote server at the IP address 167.99.186.23 with the username `root`.
    
- `-L 3336:localhost:3306`: This part of the code establishes the SSH tunnel. The `-L` flag tells SSH to create a local forward, which means that traffic on port 3336 on the local machine will be forwarded to port 3306 on the remote server. The `localhost` argument specifies that the local port is 3336, and the `3306` argument specifies that the remote port is 3306.
    

In summary, this code allows you to connect to a MySQL database server running on port 3306 on the remote server by connecting to port 3336 on your local machine.
